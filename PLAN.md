# SeNARS Complete Development Plan (Final, Enhanced)

## Introduction

This document presents the complete, reprioritized development plan for SeNARS. It has been revised to prioritize the
development and validation of a correct, reliable, and secure core reasoning system using ephemeral test cases *before*
implementing end-user functionality such as persistence or visualization UIs.

This plan codifies key architectural principles and technology choices to ensure a robust, maintainable, and agile
foundation for research and development. Each phase includes a stated **"Agile Focus"** and initiatives ordered by
priority.

## Implementation Architecture ## Optimized Implementation Architecture Development Guidelines

### Core Implementation Principles

**Modular Architecture:**
- **Abstraction**: All components should be abstracted with clear interfaces and minimal dependencies
- **Parameterization**: All configurable behavior should accept parameters rather than hardcoded values  
- **Configurability**: Systems should be driven by configuration rather than hardcoded logic
- **Reusability**: Code should be designed for maximum reuse across different contexts
- **Composability**: Components should be designed to work together in different combinations

**Quality Assurance:**
- **Test-First Development**: Write tests before implementation to ensure quality
- **Automated Validation**: Implement automated checks for all critical systems
- **Error Prevention**: Build systems that prevent errors rather than just handling them
- **Performance Validation**: Continuously validate performance metrics

**User-Centric Design:**
- **Accessibility-First**: Design for accessibility as a fundamental requirement
- **Adaptive Interfaces**: Build interfaces that adapt to user preferences and contexts
- **Intuitive Workflows**: Create intuitive user journeys with progressive disclosure

### Implementation Guidelines

1. **Modular Development**: Build independent, reusable modules with clear interfaces
2. **Configuration-Driven**: Use configuration over hardcoding for all parameterizable behavior
3. **Abstracted Architecture**: Create abstractions for common patterns and reusable components
4. **Parameterized Systems**: Design all systems to accept parameterized inputs for maximum flexibility
