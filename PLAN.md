### Component Architecture Pattern:
```javascript
// Example component structure
import React from 'react';
import { useUiStore } from '../stores/uiStore.js';

const ExamplePanel = ({ title }) => {
  const data = useUiStore(state => state.exampleData);
  
  return React.createElement('div', { className: 'panel' },
    React.createElement('h2', null, title),
    React.createElement('div', { className: 'content' },
      // Render data or components here
    )
  );
};

export default ExamplePanel;
```

### State Management Pattern:
```javascript
// Example store slice
import { create } from 'zustand';

const useUiStore = create((set, get) => ({
  // State
  exampleData: [],
  
  // Actions
  setExampleData: (data) => set({ exampleData: data }),
  updateExampleItem: (id, updates) => set(state => ({
    exampleData: state.exampleData.map(item => 
      item.id === id ? { ...item, ...updates } : item
    )
  })),
  
  // Selectors
  getExampleById: (id) => get().exampleData.find(item => item.id === id)
}));
```

### WebSocket Message Handling Pattern:
```javascript
// Example message handler
const handleMessage = (message) => {
  const { type, payload } = message;
  
  switch (type) {
    case 'reasoning.step':
      // Process reasoning step
      break;
    case 'task.created':
      // Process task creation
      break;
    default:
      console.warn('Unknown message type:', type);
  }
};
```

## Optimization Strategy & Best Practices

### Doing More with Less:
1. **Leverage Existing Systems**: Use current WebSocket infrastructure rather than building new communication layers
2. **Component Reuse**: Build generic visualization components that can display different data types
3. **Configuration Over Code**: Use configuration files to customize behavior rather than writing new code
4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Start with basic functionality and add sophistication incrementally

### Eliminating Redundancy:
1. **Single Source of Truth**: Centralize configuration and state management in Zustand stores
2. **Unified Patterns**: Use consistent component and data patterns throughout (`React.createElement` approach)
3. **Shared Utilities**: Create reusable utility functions rather than duplicating code
4. **Modular Design**: Build independent modules that can be combined in different ways

### Feature Completeness Without Bloat:
1. **Essential Features First**: Implement core functionality before advanced options
2. **Configurable Behavior**: Allow customization through parameters rather than separate implementations
3. **Plugin Architecture**: Enable extension through plugins rather than bloating core code
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Ensure basic functionality works even when advanced features are unavailable

## Success Metrics (Prototype Focus)

### Essential Technical Metrics:
- **Basic Functionality**: Core features work as expected
- **Stability**: UI doesn't crash completely during normal usage
- **Basic Test Coverage**: Key functionality has some test coverage
- **Connectivity**: WebSocket connection to core system works reliably

### Basic User Experience Metrics:
- **Usability**: Users can accomplish basic tasks with the system
- **Response Time**: UI interactions are reasonably responsive
- **Error Handling**: Errors are displayed to users rather than causing crashes

### Development Metrics:
- **Build Process**: Code compiles and runs without major errors
- **Documentation**: Key features are documented for developers
- **Code Quality**: Code follows basic style guidelines

---

## Risk Mitigation (Prototype Focus)

### Key Risks:
1. **WebSocket Integration Issues**
   - *Approach*: Focus on basic connectivity first, add advanced features later
   - *Monitoring*: Manual testing during development
   - *Contingency*: Use simple mock data for development when needed

2. **LM Provider Integration Problems**
   - *Approach*: Start with one working provider, expand later
   - *Monitoring*: Test with sample data during development
   - *Contingency*: Fall back to basic NARS reasoning when providers fail

3. **Core Functionality Not Working**
   - *Approach*: Implement and test core features incrementally
   - *Monitoring*: Regular manual testing during development
   - *Contingency*: Simplify features to ensure basics work

### Prototype Approach:
Since this is a prototype, extensive risk mitigation is not required. Focus on:
- Getting basic functionality working first
- Addressing issues as they arise through iterative development
- Keeping the scope focused on essential features
- Using simple solutions rather than complex risk mitigation systems

## Vision-Driven Development Approach

Development proceeds iteratively, with each phase delivering tangible progress toward the core vision of making hybrid intelligence observable and understandable:

### Vision-Aligned Iterative Development:
1. **Foundation for Observation** - Enable users to see communication between UI and core systems
2. **Making Reasoning Tangible** - Display reasoning processes in ways users can explore and understand
3. **Enabling Compelling Demonstrations** - Create tools that showcase hybrid intelligence effectively
4. **Ensuring Reliable Showcase** - Validate that the prototype reliably demonstrates core value

### Vision-First Development Principles:
- **Deliver observable value quickly** - Each iteration should make some aspect of hybrid intelligence more visible
- **Focus on user understanding** - Every feature should help users grasp how hybrid intelligence works
- **Enable compelling demonstrations** - Prioritize features that make great educational content or showcases
- **Use feedback to refine the vision** - Let user interactions guide which aspects of hybrid intelligence to illuminate next

### Vision Success Measurement:
Instead of rigid timelines, success is measured by:
- **Observability Milestones** - Can users see more aspects of hybrid intelligence working?
- **Understanding Indicators** - Do users grasp how NARS and LMs collaborate?
- **Demonstration Quality** - Can users create compelling content showcasing the system?
- **Engagement Evidence** - Do users spend time exploring and discovering insights?
