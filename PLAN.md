# SeNARS Complete Development Plan (Final, Enhanced)

## Introduction

This document presents the complete, reprioritized development plan for SeNARS. It has been revised to prioritize the
development and validation of a correct, reliable, and secure core reasoning system using ephemeral test cases *before*
implementing end-user functionality such as persistence or visualization UIs.

This plan codifies key architectural principles and technology choices to ensure a robust, maintainable, and agile
foundation for research and development. Each phase includes a stated **"Agile Focus"** and initiatives ordered by
priority.

## Plan Optimization & Execution Strategy

### Phase Dependency Map & Critical Path

**Critical Path (Minimum Viable Implementation):**

- This sequence delivers a functional, accessible UI with core reasoning visualization capabilities

**Parallelizable Work Streams:**
- Phase 13 (Hybrid Reasoning & Language Model Enhancement) can proceed in parallel with Phase 12 after core integration is complete
- Phase 14 (Quality Assurance & Developer Experience) can run continuously alongside other phases

**Dependencies:**
- Phase 12.1 Core Integration must be functionally complete before starting Phase 13.2 Hybrid Reasoning Patterns
- Phase 12.3 Reasoning Visualization must be stable before starting Phase 16.1 Autonomy Visualization
- Phase 15.1 Accessibility Compliance should run concurrently with all UI component development

**Single Developer Approach:**
- Focus on critical path (Phase 12 → 15 → 16) first
- Implement basic version of Phase 13 features (hybrid reasoning) as needed for enhanced reasoning
- Defer complex performance optimization and internationalization until core functionality is proven valuable

**Team Approach (2+ Developers):**
- **Developer 1**: Phase 12 & 16 (Core integration & reasoning visualization)
- **Developer 2**: Phase 13 & 14 (Hybrid reasoning & quality assurance)
- **Developer 3**: Phase 15 & UI intelligence features (Accessibility & UI intelligence)

**Resource Prioritization:**
- **High Priority**: Core integration, reasoning visualization, accessibility compliance, hybrid reasoning
- **Medium Priority**: Quality assurance systems, UI intelligence, extensibility
- **Lower Priority**: Performance optimization, internationalization, theming, collaboration features

### Testing Strategy Enhancement

**Per-Phase Testing Requirements:**
- **Phase 12**: Integration tests for UI ↔ Core communication, connection resiliency tests, schema validation tests, cross-component integration tests
- **Phase 13**: Performance benchmarks, memory leak detection tests, stress testing, virtualization validation tests, caching effectiveness tests
- **Phase 14**: Visual regression tests, automated accessibility scans, code quality gates, component isolation tests, end-to-end workflow tests
- **Phase 15**: Internationalization tests, keyboard navigation tests, screen reader tests, contrast accessibility tests, RTL layout validation
- **Phase 16**: Visualization accuracy tests, autonomy mechanism integration tests, real-time data flow validation, algorithm output verification tests

**Continuous Testing:**
- Unit tests maintained at 85%+ coverage throughout all phases with coverage reports required for PRs
- Integration tests run on every commit for critical paths with failure blocking deployment
- Performance regression tests integrated into CI pipeline with performance budgets
- Accessibility audits integrated into development workflow with automated scanning
- Cross-browser compatibility testing for critical user journeys

**Testing Infrastructure:**
- Comprehensive test suite with unit, integration, e2e, and performance tests
- Automated visual regression testing using Playwright or similar tools
- Performance benchmarking suite to track optimization impact
- Accessibility testing pipeline with WCAG compliance checking

### Versioning & Release Strategy

**Incremental Release Approach:**
- **Release 1.0**: Core NAR functionality with basic UI and Phase 12 completion (Essential integration and reliability)
- **Release 1.1**: Add Phase 15 accessibility features and basic Phase 13 performance improvements (Accessibility and stability)
- **Release 1.2**: Complete extensibility (Phase 13.2) and advanced visualization (Phase 16) (Extensibility and autonomy)
- **Release 1.3**: Full internationalization (Phase 15.2) and adaptive features (Phase 15.3) (Globalization and intelligence)

**Release Quality Gates:**
- **Pre-Release**: All unit and integration tests passing, performance benchmarks met, accessibility audit passed
- **Feature Complete**: Specific phase requirements met as defined in actionable steps, comprehensive test coverage maintained
- **Production Ready**: End-to-end workflow testing passed, cross-browser compatibility verified, security audit completed

**Backward Compatibility:**
- Maintain API compatibility between versions during development using versioned endpoints
- Use feature flags for experimental features (Phase 15.3) to enable safe rollouts
- Implement proper deprecation warnings and migration paths before breaking changes
- Support gradual migration with dual-version API support when needed

**Release Artifacts:**
- Production-ready UI build with optimized assets
- Comprehensive API documentation synchronized with code
- Configuration templates and migration guides
- Performance and accessibility compliance reports

This refined plan provides a comprehensive roadmap with clear dependencies, risk mitigation, quality standards, and practical execution guidance for successful implementation.
