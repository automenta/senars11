# SeNARS Complete Development Plan (Final, Enhanced)

## Introduction

This document presents the complete, reprioritized development plan for SeNARS. It has been revised to prioritize the
development and validation of a correct, reliable, and secure core reasoning system using ephemeral test cases *before*
implementing end-user functionality such as persistence or visualization UIs.

This plan codifies key architectural principles and technology choices to ensure a robust, maintainable, and agile
foundation for research and development. Each phase includes a stated **"Agile Focus"** and initiatives ordered by
priority.

### Phase 12: Foundation Enhancement (UI Development)

**Agile Focus**: Maximize reliability and usability of the web-based user interface to establish a robust user experience foundation.

**Technology Stack & Architecture**:
- **Build Tool/Dev Server**: Vite - Lightning-fast development server with live reload/hot module replacement (HMR) for instant updates.
- **Frontend Framework**: React (using plain JavaScript, no JSX) - Component-based architecture ideal for logic-oriented hierarchies and shared elements, using `React.createElement()` exclusively.
- **Docking Framework**: FlexLayout - Provides IDE-like features such as drag-and-drop panels, nested tabs, splits, and persistence.
- **State Management**: Zustand - Lightweight, minimal boilerplate compared to Redux, ideal for complex hierarchies with slice state by component or feature.
- **Styling**: Vanilla CSS Modules - Scoped styling per component with no extra build steps beyond Vite's built-in CSS handling.
- **WebSocket Integration**: Native WebSocket API - Simple, direct for real-time server communication with Zod schema validation.
- **Testing Framework**: Playwright + Vitest - End-to-end browser emulation and unit tests on components/state.
- **Linting and Formatting**: ESLint + Prettier - Enforce code consistency and catch issues early.

## Optimized Implementation Architecture

### Core Design Principles

**Modular Architecture:**
- **Abstraction**: All components should be abstracted with clear interfaces and minimal dependencies
- **Parameterization**: All configurable behavior should accept parameters rather than hardcoded values  
- **Configurability**: Systems should be driven by configuration rather than hardcoded logic
- **Reusability**: Code should be designed for maximum reuse across different contexts
- **Composability**: Components should be designed to work together in different combinations

**Quality Assurance:**
- **Test-First Development**: Write tests before implementation to ensure quality
- **Automated Validation**: Implement automated checks for all critical systems
- **Error Prevention**: Build systems that prevent errors rather than just handling them
- **Performance Validation**: Continuously validate performance metrics

**User-Centric Design:**
- **Accessibility-First**: Design for accessibility as a fundamental requirement
- **Adaptive Interfaces**: Build interfaces that adapt to user preferences and contexts
- **Intuitive Workflows**: Create intuitive user journeys with progressive disclosure
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure optimal experience across all device types

### Implementation Guidelines

1. **Modular Development**: Build independent, reusable modules with clear interfaces
2. **Configuration-Driven**: Use configuration over hardcoding for all parameterizable behavior
3. **Abstracted Architecture**: Create abstractions for common patterns and reusable components
4. **Parameterized Systems**: Design all systems to accept parameterized inputs for maximum flexibility
5. **Comprehensive Testing**: Implement testing at unit, integration, and end-to-end levels
6. **Performance Conscious**: Optimize for performance at every layer of the application

### Development Workflow

1. Initialize: `npm create vite@latest my-ui --template react` (adapt for plain JS).
2. Install Dependencies: `npm install react react-dom flexlayout-react zustand zod @playwright/test vitest`.
3. Setup Scripts in package.json:
    - `dev`: `vite`
    - `test`: `vitest`
    - `e2e`: `playwright test`
    - `lint`: `eslint src`
4. Develop: Code components with `createElement`, connect WebSocket in App.js, define layouts in FlexLayout.
5. Test: Write/run Playwright scripts to emulate browser, mock WebSockets, assert no runtime errors.
6. Extend: For agent control/demos, expose WebSocket endpoints for external commands (e.g., updatePanel).

## Assumptions and Extensibility

- Server: Assumes a Node.js backend with WebSocket support (e.g., ws library). Zod schemas shared via monorepo or copied
  file.
- No Production Build Details: Focus on dev; use `vite build` for dist when ready.
- Future-Proof: Architecture supports adding features like interaction demos or AI control without rework—e.g.,
  dedicated WebSocket channels per panel.
- Constraints: No TypeScript, no JSX, minimal build steps. If needs evolve, revisit (e.g., add Redux if Zustand
  insufficient).

This optimized plan emphasizes modularity, parameterization, and configurability to ensure the system is elegant, maintainable, and highly adaptable to changing requirements.
