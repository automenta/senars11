/**
 * AsyncReduction.js - Async reduction functions
 * This file contains async-specific reduction functions that were part of the original Reduce.js
 * Note: These are now integrated into DeterministicReduction.js and NonDeterministicReduction.js
 * This file exists to maintain the modular structure as outlined in TODO.metta.refactor.md
 */

// This file serves as a placeholder to maintain the modular structure.
// The async functions are implemented in DeterministicReduction.js and NonDeterministicReduction.js
// as they are extensions of the core reduction algorithms.
