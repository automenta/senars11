## Core Philosophy: A Dynamic Stream of Consciousness

SeNARS embodies a sophisticated **"stream of consciousness"** architecture that operates intelligently under the
constraints of **finite computational resources**. Unlike traditional batch-processing systems, SeNARS functions as a
dynamic, continuously running cognitive agent that makes intelligent, real-time decisions about what to "think" about at
any given moment.

The fundamental principle governing this cognitive process is **Economic Attention**. Given that the system cannot
simultaneously reason about its entire knowledge base, it employs a sophisticated attention mechanism. In each cognitive
**`Cycle`**, the system strategically selects a small, optimized `focusSet` of the most salient `Task`s.

This attention focus is determined by a highly sophisticated **`PriorityManager`** that calculates priority scores using
multiple factors:

- **Goal Relevance**: How closely a task relates to current objectives
- **Temporal Factors**: Recency and time-sensitive importance
- **Truth Value Certainty**: Confidence and evidential support
- **Cognitive Value**: Potential to generate new insights or achieve goals

This intelligent resource allocation ensures that the system's limited computational resources are always directed
toward the most promising and valuable cognitive activities, maximizing the efficiency and effectiveness of the
reasoning process.

## The Three Pillars: Term, Task, and Memory

The entire cognitive architecture is built upon three fundamental, interdependent data structures that work in harmony
to enable sophisticated reasoning and learning.

### 🔤 Pillar 1: The `Term` - The Immutable Vocabulary of Thought

A `Term` represents the immutable, atomic foundation of all conceptual knowledge in the system. Defined in
`core/core/Term.js`, it serves as the fundamental building block for all cognitive operations.

**Structural Complexity & Expressiveness:**

* **Atomic Terms**: Simple, indivisible concepts like `cat`, `red`, or `motion`.
* **Compound Terms**: Complex concepts built from other terms using sophisticated Narsese grammar:
    * **Inheritance Relationships**: `(cat --> animal)` representing "cats are animals"
    * **Predictive Implications**: `((&, dark_clouds, wind) =/> rain)` representing "if dark clouds and wind, then rain
      follows"
    * **Complex Conjunctions**: `(&, hungry, food_available, time_evening)` representing multiple concurrent conditions
    * **Negations and Disjunctions**: `(--, (cat --> bird))` representing "not (cats are birds)"
    * **Temporal Relations**: `(<->, morning, evening)` representing bidirectional temporal relationships

**Advanced Design Features:**

* **Immutability**: Once a `Term` is created, its conceptual meaning remains fixed, providing a stable foundation for
  logical reasoning and preventing inconsistencies during complex inference chains.
* **Lazy Parsing**: Complex terms like `(A --> B)` are initially stored as strings. Their internal structure (e.g.,
  `subject: A`, `predicate: B`, `type: Inheritance`) is parsed and cached only on-demand, ensuring optimal memory usage
  and computational efficiency.
* **Semantic Grounding**: Each `Term` can be associated with high-dimensional vector **embeddings** that ground its
  symbolic meaning in semantic space. This enables the neuro-symbolic bridge, allowing the `LM` to calculate semantic
  similarity and support analogical reasoning.
* **Caching & Optimization**: Terms include intelligent caching mechanisms for frequently accessed properties, reducing
  computational overhead during reasoning operations.
* **Validation & Consistency**: All terms undergo rigorous validation to ensure syntactic correctness and logical
  consistency within the overall knowledge base.

### 🎯 Pillar 2: The `Task` - The Dynamic Atom of Cognition

A `Task` represents the stateful, dynamic unit of all cognitive work, embodying a piece of knowledge the system is
actively "thinking" about. Defined in `core/core/Task.js`, a `Task` wraps a `Term` and imbues it with rich contextual
state and temporal dynamics.

**Comprehensive Structure:**

* **Term Reference**: A reference to the immutable `Term` that defines the core concept
* **Punctuation System**: Defines the task's fundamental cognitive type:
    * `.` (Belief): A statement about the world (e.g., `(cat --> mammal).` with confidence 0.9)
    * `!` (Goal): A desired state the system aims to achieve (e.g., `(clean_kitchen)!` with priority 0.8)
    * `?` (Question): An information query seeking specific knowledge (e.g., `(cat_purr_frequency)?`)

**Dynamic State Management:**

* **Truth Value System**: An object `{ frequency, confidence }` representing the system's assessment of the task's
  accuracy:
    * **Frequency**: The evidential support (0.0 to 1.0) indicating how often the statement has been observed to be true
    * **Confidence**: The certainty (0.0 to 1.0) indicating how reliable the frequency estimate is
    * **Bayesian Updates**: Truth values are continuously updated using sophisticated Bayesian revision when new
      evidence is encountered
* **Priority Management**: A dynamic float value (0.0 to 1.0) indicating the task's current importance in the cognitive
  cycle, calculated by the **`PriorityManager`** using algorithms that consider relevance, urgency, and potential impact
* **Temporal Stamps**: Comprehensive timestamping system including:
    * `creationTime`: When the task was first created
    * `lastAccessed`: When the task was last processed
    * `occurrenceTime`: When the represented event occurred (for temporal reasoning)
    * `expirationTime`: When the task becomes obsolete (optional)
* **Cognitive State**: Additional metadata tracking the task's role in ongoing reasoning processes, including whether
  it's part of active inference chains or planning operations
* **Provenance Tracking**: Information about the task's origin, including which rules created it or which external
  sources provided it

### 💾 Pillar 3: The `Memory` - The Intelligent Knowledge Hypergraph

The `Memory` module (`core/memory/Memory.js`) represents the central, sophisticated repository for all `Term`s and
`Task`s. It transcends a simple database to function as a highly structured and dynamically adaptive knowledge
hypergraph with intelligent management capabilities.

**Advanced Dual-Store Architecture:**

* **`shortTermTasks`**: A high-performance map holding new and recently accessed tasks, serving as the primary workspace
  for active cognitive operations. Optimized for rapid access and frequent updates during reasoning cycles.
* **`longTermTasks`**: A comprehensive map for important, high-confidence knowledge that has been consolidated from
  short-term memory. Designed for efficient retrieval of stable, foundational knowledge.
* **Consolidation Mechanisms**: Sophisticated algorithms determine which information should be moved from short-term to
  long-term storage based on importance, frequency of access, and truth value stability.

**Specialized Indexing & Retrieval:**

* **Intelligent Indexing**: The **`MemoryIndexer`** maintains multiple specialized indices to enable lightning-fast
  retrieval during reasoning:
    * `implicationIndex`: Enables the `Reasoner` to instantly find all rules relevant to achieving specific goals
    * `inheritanceIndex`: Facilitates rapid inheritance-based reasoning
    * `temporalIndex`: Supports efficient temporal reasoning operations
    * `similarityIndex`: Enables fast semantic similarity searches using vector embeddings
* **Vector Search Capabilities**: Integration of vector databases allows for semantic search and similarity-based
  retrieval beyond simple symbolic matching
* **Adaptive Query Optimization**: The memory system learns and adapts its indexing strategies based on usage patterns

**Advanced Memory Management:**

* **Adaptive Forgetting**: Sophisticated **`TimeBasedForgettingStrategy`** and **`PriorityBasedForgettingStrategy`**
  mechanisms periodically prune old, low-priority, or low-confidence tasks, ensuring the knowledge base remains focused,
  efficient, and relevant
* **Forgetting Algorithms**: Multiple forgetting strategies including exponential decay, priority-based pruning, and
  relevance-based consolidation
* **Memory Consolidation**: Processes that strengthen important connections while pruning weak ones, similar to how
  human memory operates
