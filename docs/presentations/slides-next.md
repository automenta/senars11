## Core Components: Term, Task, and Memory

SeNARS is built on three fundamental components:

<div class="grid grid-cols-3 gap-4 mb-4">
  <div class="text-center p-4 bg-blue-500 bg-opacity-20 rounded">
    <div class="text-2xl">üî§</div>

    <div class="font-bold text-lg">Memory</div>
    <div class="text-sm">Knowledge Graph</div>
  </div>
</div>

---

## Understanding Terms

**Term** - Immutable representations of concepts:

- **Examples**: `cat`, `(cat --> animal)`, `(cat ==> furry)`
- **Key Properties**:
    - Parses their own structure for efficiency
    - Grounded with semantic embeddings from LMs
    - Serve as the stable vocabulary of the system

```javascript
// Example Term structure
const catTerm = new Term('cat');
const inheritanceTerm = new Term('(cat --> animal)');
```

Terms are the building blocks of all knowledge in SeNARS, providing:

- **Semantic Grounding**: Connected to meaning through LM embeddings
- **Structural Intelligence**: Self-parsing for efficient access to components
- **Stability**: Immutable nature ensures consistency across reasoning

---

## Understanding Tasks

**Task** - Stateful cognitive atoms representing beliefs, goals, or questions:

- **Structure**:
    - `id`: Unique identifier
    - `termKey`: Foreign key to a Term
    - `punctuation`: `.`, `!`, or `?` (Belief, Goal, Question)
- **State**:
    - Truth values (frequency, confidence)
    - Dynamic priorities for attention allocation
    - Temporal stamps (creation, occurrence times)

```javascript
// Example Task structure
const beliefTask = new Task(
    '(cat --> animal)',
    '.',
    {frequency: 1.0, confidence: 0.9}
);
```

Tasks represent the dynamic aspects of cognition:

- **Evidence-Based**: Truth values updated through Bayesian revision
- **Attention-Aware**: Priority scores for economic attention model
- **Time-Conscious**: Temporal stamps for reasoning about events

---

## Understanding Memory

**Memory** - Unified knowledge hypergraph managing Terms and Tasks:

- **Dual Storage System**:
    - Short-term: Active tasks prioritized for immediate processing
    - Long-term: Consolidated tasks with high importance/confidence
- **Specialized Indexes**:
    - Belief Index: For efficient retrieval
    - Implication Index: For planning knowledge
    - Cost Index: For action costs
- **Forgetting Mechanisms**: Time-based pruning of expired tasks

## Understanding the SeNARS Architecture

At its core, SeNARS is built on a **Unified Knowledge Hypergraph**:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "SeNARS Cognitive Core"
        Reasoner[Reasoner Symbolic Inference & Meta-Cognition]
        Memory[MEMORY Term Hypergraph & Task Collection]
        LM[LM LM-Powered Engine]

        Reasoner <--> Memory
        Reasoner -- Triggers on Gaps/Needs --> LM
        LM -- Injects Knowledge --> Memory
    end

    subgraph "Interfaces"
        Perception -- Creates Tasks --> Memory
        ActionSystem -- Executes Goals from --> Reasoner
    end

    subgraph "Foundational Layer"
        Constitution[CONSTITUTION Immutable Drives & Constraints] -- Provides Salience Gradients --> Memory
    end
```

---

## How SeNARS "Thinks"

Think of SeNARS as a **digital brain** with distinct yet synergistic components:

1. **The Logical "Conscious Mind" (Reasoner)**
    - Handles formal, step-by-step reasoning
    - Analytical and auditable
    - Ensures every decision can be fully explained

2. **The Creative "Subconscious" (LM)**
    - Provides intuition and semantic understanding
    - Source of novel ideas and fluent language
    - Grounds symbolic knowledge in meaning

3. **The Self-Awareness (Meta-Cognition)**
    - Constantly checks for errors
    - Improves thinking over time
    - Ensures consistency and coherence

---

## The Cognitive Cycle

SeNARS operates in discrete cognitive cycles that emulate a stream of consciousness:

1. **Perception** üëÅÔ∏è: Ingest new information from the world
2. **Prioritization** üéØ: Apply economic attention to all tasks
3. **Meta-Cognition** üîç: Detect and analyze reasoning failures
4. **Reasoning** üß†: Perform inference on salient tasks
5. **Enrichment** üå±: Process new terms and execute goals

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Perception] --> B[Prioritization]
    B --> C[Meta-Cognition]
    C --> D[Reasoning]
    D --> E[Enrichment]
    E --> F[Action]
    F --> A
```

Each cycle is a complete reasoning loop, ensuring continuous learning and adaptation.

---

## Economic Attention Model and Formal Reasoning

SeNARS implements a pragmatic attention mechanism that focuses computational resources like a stream of consciousness.

Priority calculation factors:
| Factor | Description | Impact |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **Truth Value** | Confidence and frequency | Higher confidence = higher priority |
| **Complexity** | Structural complexity | Lower complexity = higher priority |
| **Relevance** | Relationship to active goals | More relevant = higher priority |
| **Temporal Factors** | Recency and urgency | More recent/urgent = higher priority |

SeNARS implements rigorous, explainable reasoning through formal inference rules:

| Rule             | Structure                          | Purpose                        |
|------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Deduction**    | `(M --> P), (S --> M) ‚ä¢ (S --> P)` | Classical logical deduction    |
| **Induction**    | `(M --> P), (M --> S) ‚ä¢ (S --> P)` | Evidence-based generalization  |
| **Abduction**    | `(P --> M), (S --> M) ‚ä¢ (S --> P)` | Hypothesis generation          |
| **Analogy**      | `(M --> P), (M <-> S) ‚ä¢ (S --> P)` | Structure-preserving inference |
| **Modus Ponens** | `(P ==> Q), P ‚ä¢ Q`                 | Conditional reasoning          |

---

## The Neuro-Symbolic Bridge

SeNARS integrates LMs as a suite of specialized services, not a black box:

- **HypothesisGenerator**: Creative abduction and pattern discovery
- **PlanRepairer**: Novel solutions when plans fail
- **ProactiveEnricher**: Expanding knowledge graph based on new info
- **QAService**: Fluent natural language interaction
- **ExplanationGenerator**: Translate formal reasoning into natural language

This creates powerful synergy: the **Reasoner** provides rigor, while the **LM** provides creativity and grounding.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Symbolic Reasoner] <--> B[Memory]
    B <--> C[LM Engine]

    C --> C1[HypothesisGenerator]
    C --> C2[PlanRepairer]
    C --> C3[ProactiveEnricher]
    C --> C4[QAService]
    C --> C5[ExplanationGenerator]

    A -- Insufficient --> C
    C -- Enriched Knowledge --> B
```

---

## Meta-Cognition and Planning

SeNARS is designed for **recursive self-improvement**:

1. **Detection**: Constantly scans for contradictions between new conclusions and existing beliefs
2. **Analysis**: Classifies conflicts and selects best resolution strategy
3. **Correction**: Generates new Tasks (e.g., Questions) with high priority to resolve inconsistencies

| Strategy               | Approach                     | Use Case                           |
|------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Revision**           | Truth value revision         | Directly conflicting beliefs       |
| **Reconciliation**     | Contextual resolution        | Beliefs true in different contexts |
| **Evidence Gathering** | Generate questions           | Need more information              |
| **Temporal Analysis**  | Time-based resolution        | Temporal conflicts                 |
| **Causal Analysis**    | Examine causal relationships | Causal contradictions              |

SeNARS supports multiple planning strategies for goal achievement:

| Strategy                            | Approach                                       | Benefits                              |
|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **HTN (Hierarchical Task Network)** | Decompose complex goals into primitive actions | Structured, systematic planning       |
| **A* Search**                       | Graph-based pathfinding with heuristics        | Optimal solutions with custom weights |

Key features:

- Plan cost calculation
- Task difficulty assessment
- Dynamic strategy selection
- Plan validation (check if goals already achieved)

---

## Temporal Reasoning

SeNARS implements sophisticated temporal reasoning capabilities:

- **Temporal Relationship Inference**: Determine relationships between events
- **Pattern Detection**: Identify periodic and sequential patterns
- **Future Prediction**: Forecast future task occurrences
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identify temporal anomalies

Specialized temporal term types:

- **Predictive Implication**: `(task1 => task2)` - task1 predicts task2
- **Retrospective Implication**: `(task1 =/> task2)` - task1 implies task2 occurred after
- **Concurrent Implication**: `(task1 =<> task2)` - task1 and task2 occur concurrently

---

## The Constitution: Immutable Foundation

The **`Constitution`** defines the system's core motives and safety constraints:

**Core Drives** (High-priority, permanent goals):

- `AcquireKnowledge!` - Fundamental drive to learn and understand
- `ReduceUncertainty!` - Drive to resolve unknowns and ambiguities
- `MaintainCoherence!` - Drive to resolve contradictions and maintain consistency
- `MaintainCognitiveIntegrity!` - Meta-cognitive drive for self-improvement

**Safety Constraints** (Immutable beliefs about negative outcomes):

- `((&, self, cause_harm) ==> NEGATIVE_OUTCOME).`

The `Constitution` bootstraps the attention mechanism and anchors behavior to foundational principles.

---

## Narsese: Formal Knowledge Representation

SeNARS supports a comprehensive set of Narsese expressions:

| Type                       | Syntax                     | Example                             |
|----------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Atomic Terms**           | Simple identifiers         | `cat`                               |
| **Inheritance**            | `(subject --> predicate)`  | `(cat --> mammal)`                  |
| **Implication**            | `(premise ==> conclusion)` | `(cat ==> furry)`                   |
| **Negation**               | `(--, term)`               | `(--, cat)`                         |
| **Conjunction**            | `(&, term1, term2, ...)`   | `(&, cat, dog)`                     |
| **Disjunction**            | `(                         |                                     |, term1, term2, ...)` | `(||, cat, dog)` |
| **Extensional Difference** | `(#, term1, term2)`        | `(#, cat, dog)`                     |
| **Intensional Difference** | `(\, term1, term2)`        | `(\, cat, dog)`                     |
| **Instance**               | `(term {-- class)`         | `(cat {-- animal)`                  |
| **Property**               | `(term --} property)`      | `(cat --} furry)`                   |
| **Nested Expressions**     | Complex combinations       | `(cat --> (&, furry, intelligent))` |

This formal language enables precise knowledge representation and logical reasoning.

## Narsese: A Deeper Dive

Narsese is a formal language designed for knowledge representation in AI systems that operate under uncertainty.

**Key Features:**

- **Experience-Grounded Semantics**: Meaning is derived from the system's experiences, not predefined axioms.
- **Unified Representation**: Represents diverse types of knowledge, including beliefs, goals, and questions.
- **Simple Syntax**: A small set of term constructors can be combined to create complex expressions.
- **Truth-Value System**: Each statement is associated with a truth value that represents evidence from experience.

**Example: `(cat --> animal). %1.0;0.9%`**

- `(cat --> animal)`: The statement, representing the inheritance relationship.
- `%1.0;0.9%`: The truth value, indicating high frequency and confidence.

This structure allows SeNARS to reason about the world in a way that is both formal and flexible.

---

## Implementation Details

SeNARS is implemented with modern software engineering practices:

- **Language**: JavaScript/Node.js for cross-platform compatibility
- **Architecture**: Event-driven design with decoupled components
- **Performance**: Probabilistic data structures for efficient task selection
- **Extensibility**: Plugin architecture for adding new capabilities
- **Testing**: Comprehensive unit and integration tests
- **Documentation**: Self-documenting code with inline examples

Key implementation features:
