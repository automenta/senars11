## Core Components: Term, Task, and Memory

SeNARS is built on three fundamental components:

<div class="grid grid-cols-3 gap-4 mb-4">
  <div class="text-center p-4 bg-blue-500 bg-opacity-20 rounded">
    <div class="text-2xl">🔤</div>

    <div class="font-bold text-lg">Memory</div>
    <div class="text-sm">Knowledge Graph</div>
  </div>
</div>

---

## Understanding Terms

**Term** - Immutable representations of concepts:

- **Examples**: `cat`, `(cat --> animal)`, `(cat ==> furry)`
- **Key Properties**:
    - Strict immutability with frozen objects
    - Efficient caching and normalization in TermFactory
    - Structural intelligence with component access, visitors, and reducers

```javascript
// Example Term structure
const catTerm = new Term({
    components: ['cat'],
    operator: null
});
const inheritanceTerm = new Term({
    components: [catTerm, new Term({components: ['animal']})],
    operator: '-->'
});
```

Terms are the building blocks of all knowledge in SeNARS, providing:

- **Normalization**: Automatic reduction of equivalent terms (e.g., `(&, A, B)` = `(&, B, A)`)
- **Efficient Comparison**: SHA256-based hashing for fast equality checks
- **Immutability**: Ensures consistency across reasoning with frozen objects

---

## Understanding Tasks

**Task** - Stateful cognitive atoms representing beliefs, goals, or questions:

- **Structure**:
    - `term`: Reference to a Term object
    - `punctuation`: `.`, `!`, or `?` (Belief, Goal, Question)
    - `truth`: Truth value object with frequency and confidence
    - `stamp`: Evidence tracking with origin and derivation history
- **State**:
    - Truth values (frequency, confidence) for Bayesian revision
    - Budget metrics for attention allocation (priority, durability, quality)

```javascript
// Example Task structure
const beliefTask = new Task({
    term: inheritanceTerm,
    punctuation: '.',
    truth: new Truth(1.0, 0.9),
    budget: { priority: 0.8, durability: 0.7, quality: 0.9 }
});
```

Tasks represent the dynamic aspects of cognition:

- **Typed Punctuation**: Clear distinction between beliefs, goals, and questions
- **Evidence Tracking**: Complete derivation history with timestamps
- **Attention Management**: Dynamic budget metrics for cognitive focus

---

## Understanding Memory

**Memory** - Concept-based knowledge graph managing Terms and Tasks:

- **Dual Storage System**:
    - Focus sets: Short-term memory with high-priority tasks
    - Long-term storage: All concepts and tasks with adaptive consolidation
- **Concept Management**:
    - Each concept holds related tasks for the same term
    - Specialized indexes for different term types (inheritance, implication, etc.)
- **Forgetting Mechanisms**: Adaptive consolidation based on priority and activation

## Understanding the SeNARS Architecture

At its core, SeNARS is built on a **Component-Based Architecture**:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "SeNARS Cognitive Core"
        NAR[NAR Main Engine]
        Memory[MEMORY Concept-Based Storage]
        LM[LM Language Model Integration]
        RE[RuleEngine NAL & LM Rules]
        Cycle[CYCLE Reasoning Loop]

        NAR <--> Memory
        NAR --> RE
        RE <--> Memory
        RE --> LM
        Cycle --> NAR
    end

    subgraph "Interfaces"
        Parser -- Creates Tasks --> Memory
        IO -- Inputs/Outputs --> NAR
    end

    subgraph "Foundation Layer"
        Config[CONFIGURATION System-wide Settings]
        Component[BaseComponent Standardized Architecture]
    end
```

---

## How SeNARS "Thinks"

Think of SeNARS as a **digital brain** with distinct yet synergistic components:

1. **The Logical "Conscious Mind" (RuleEngine)**
    - Handles formal, step-by-step reasoning
    - Analytical and auditable through event-based tracing
    - Ensures every decision can be fully explained

2. **The Creative "Subconscious" (LM)**
    - Provides intuition and semantic understanding
    - Source of novel ideas and fluent language
    - Grounds symbolic knowledge in meaning

3. **The Self-Awareness (Meta-Cognition)**
    - Constantly monitors reasoning performance
    - Improves thinking through feedback loops
    - Ensures consistency and coherence

---

## The Cognitive Cycle

SeNARS operates in discrete cognitive cycles that emulate a stream of consciousness:

1. **Perception** 👁️: Ingest new information from the world
2. **Focus Selection** 🎯: Apply attention to salient tasks in focus sets
3. **Rule Application** 🔍: Apply relevant NAL and LM rules to tasks
4. **Memory Consolidation** 🧠: Update knowledge graph and manage attention
5. **Output Generation** 🌱: Produce answers, beliefs, or actions

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Input Processing] --> B[Focus Task Selection]
    B --> C[Rule Application]
    C --> D[Memory Update]
    D --> E[Output Generation]
    E --> F[Task Consolidation]
    F --> A
```

Each cycle is a complete reasoning loop, ensuring continuous learning and adaptation.

---

## Attention Model and Formal Reasoning

SeNARS implements a pragmatic attention mechanism that focuses computational resources like a stream of consciousness.

Budget calculation factors:
| Factor | Description | Impact |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **Priority** | Task importance metric | Higher priority = higher selection probability |
| **Durability** | Persistence requirements | Longer-term tasks maintained in focus |
| **Quality** | Relevance and usefulness | Higher quality tasks receive more attention |

SeNARS implements rigorous, explainable reasoning through formal inference rules:

| Rule             | Structure                          | Purpose                        |
|------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Deduction**    | `(M --> P), (S --> M) ⊢ (S --> P)` | Classical logical deduction    |
| **Induction**    | `(M --> P), (M --> S) ⊢ (S --> P)` | Evidence-based generalization  |
| **Abduction**    | `(P --> M), (S --> M) ⊢ (S --> P)` | Hypothesis generation          |
| **Analogy**      | `(M --> P), (M <-> S) ⊢ (S --> P)` | Structure-preserving inference |
| **Modus Ponens** | `(P ==> Q), P ⊢ Q`                 | Conditional reasoning          |

---

## The Neuro-Symbolic Bridge

SeNARS integrates LMs as a specialized service layer rather than a black box:

- **ProviderRegistry**: Registry and selection of multiple LM providers
- **ModelSelector**: Dynamic model selection based on task requirements
- **NarseseTranslator**: Bidirectional translation between Narsese and natural language
- **CircuitBreaker**: Resilient operation with fallback mechanisms

This creates powerful synergy: the **RuleEngine** provides rigor, while the **LM** provides creativity and grounding.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[RuleEngine NAL & LM Rules] <--> B[Memory Concept Storage]
    B <--> C[LM Language Model Engine]

    C --> C1[ProviderRegistry]
    C --> C2[ModelSelector]
    C --> C3[NarseseTranslator]
    C --> C4[CircuitBreaker]

    A -- Triggers when needed --> C
    C -- Enriched Knowledge --> B
    B -- Provides context --> A
```

---

## Meta-Cognition and Reasoning

SeNARS is designed for **adaptive self-improvement**:

1. **Performance Monitoring**: Constantly tracks rule effectiveness and reasoning outcomes
2. **Analysis**: Classifies successful and failed reasoning patterns
3. **Adaptation**: Adjusts rule priorities and reasoning strategies based on metrics

| Strategy               | Approach                     | Use Case                           |
|------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Rule Effectiveness** | Track success/failure rates  | Adapt rule selection and priorities|
| **Performance Metrics**| Monitor execution times      | Optimize reasoning workflows        |
| **Cognitive Load**     | Balance task complexity      | Maintain reasoning efficiency       |
| **Resource Management**| Adaptive memory consolidation| Optimize memory utilization         |
| **Error Recovery**     | Circuit breaker mechanisms   | Maintain system resilience          |

Key features:

- Performance optimization with caching strategies
- Dynamic rule selection based on task type
- Resilient operation with fallback mechanisms

---

## Temporal Reasoning

SeNARS implements sophisticated temporal reasoning capabilities through:

- **Stamp Management**: Complete event tracing with timestamps and derivation history
- **Evidence Tracking**: Maintains complete origin and evidence chain for every piece of knowledge
- **Temporal Coherence**: Ensures consistency of temporal relationships between events

Specialized temporal concepts:

- **Occurrence Time**: When tasks were created or observed
- **Derivation History**: Complete chain of reasoning steps leading to conclusions
- **Evidential Base**: Set of direct evidence supporting each belief

---

## Component Architecture: BaseComponent

SeNARS implements a robust component architecture with standardized interfaces:

**BaseComponent Features**:
- **Initialization Framework**: Standardized initialization with configuration support
- **Metrics Collection**: Base metrics and statistics gathering
- **Logging Integration**: Consistent logging across all components

- **Configuration System**: Centralized configuration with validation and defaults

```javascript
class Memory extends BaseComponent {
    constructor(config = {}) {
        super(config, 'Memory');
        this._config = {...this.config, ...config};
        // Component-specific initialization
    }
}
```

This architecture ensures consistent behavior and maintainability across all system components.

---

## Narsese: Formal Knowledge Representation

SeNARS supports a comprehensive set of Narsese expressions:

| Type                       | Syntax                     | Example                             |
|----------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Atomic Terms**           | Simple identifiers         | `cat`                               |
| **Inheritance**            | `(subject --> predicate)`  | `(cat --> mammal)`                  |
| **Implication**            | `(premise ==> conclusion)` | `(cat ==> furry)`                   |
| **Negation**               | `(--, term)`               | `(--, cat)`                         |
| **Conjunction**            | `(&, term1, term2, ...)`   | `(&, cat, dog)`                     |
| **Disjunction**            | `(\|, term1, term2, ...)` | `(\|, cat, dog)`                    |
| **Extensional Difference** | `(#, term1, term2)`        | `(#, cat, dog)`                     |
| **Intensional Difference** | `(\, term1, term2)`        | `(\, cat, dog)`                     |
| **Instance**               | `(term {-- class)`         | `(cat {-- animal)`                  |
| **Property**               | `(term --} property)`      | `(cat --} furry)`                   |
