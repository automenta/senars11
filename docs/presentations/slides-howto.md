# Slidedeck for software research

- Purpose: Business success, while also being educational
- Consider all relevant types of slides that may appear in a slidedeck, different ways to re-frame them.
- Ideal and ergonomic slide order and structure
- Focus on the software, not the team

### The Software

- Confident prototype phase of research, wanting to accelerate growth
- Since it applies to nearly every problem domain, defer choosing specific products/services/business strategy.
- The technology is, on its face, ground-breaking
- Backed by years of academic research
- Open-source license

### Style

- Verbal minimalism:  Few words, and fewer complete sentences. Zen-like in clarity and elegance. instead, utilizing,
  where possible: diagrams, tables, lists. Distill the essence, remaining complete, disobeying unnecessary conventional
  narrative/prose boilerplate.
- Brief, concise: the potential should be obvious after the first few slides. If they're interested they can continue as
  far as they wish. This plays into the verbal minimalism aesthetic.

### Philosophy

* **Show, Don't Tell:** Every slide should demonstrate a truth rather than state it. The technology's power should be a
  conclusion the audience reaches, not a claim you make.
* **Progressive Disclosure:** The deck is structured in modules. An investor can get the core idea in the first module (
  3 slides) and stop. If intrigued, they can continue through each module for deeper understanding of the technology,
  market, and plan.
* **Confidence Through Clarity:** The minimalism isn't just aesthetic; it's a strategic tool. It implies the technology
  is so fundamental that it doesn't need hype or jargon.

### The Slidedeck Structure: A Four-Act Narrative

The deck is broken into four modules, each answering a fundamental question.

| Module                   | Question Answered   | Purpose                                           |
|--------------------------|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **I. The Revelation**    | *What is this?*     | Hook the audience. Make the impossible, possible. |
| **II. The Substance**    | *How does it work?* | Build credibility. Ground the magic in reality.   |
| **III. The Opportunity** | *So what?*          | Connect technology to immense value.              |
| **IV. The Plan**         | *Now what?*         | Provide a clear path from research to revenue.    |

### Module I: The Revelation (The 3-Slide Hook)

*(Goal: If they only see these three slides, they should be intrigued enough to ask for a meeting.)*

#### **Slide 1: The Title**

* **Title:** A single, profound statement of the breakthrough. Not a product name.
    * *Examples: "A New Primitive for Computation," "Unlocking Exponential Complexity," or "Beyond the Turing Machine."*
* **Visual:** An abstract, elegant graphic or animation that visually represents the core concept (e.g., a complex knot
  untangling, a chaotic system finding order).
* **Subtitle:** [Project Name] | [Link to GitHub/Website]

#### **Slide 2: The Paradigm Shift**

* **Title:** The Old Way // The New Way
* **Visual:** A simple, two-panel diagram.
    * **Left Panel ("The Old Way"):** Shows a common, accepted limitation in computing. Depict it as a wall, a maze, or
      a complex, tangled graph. Label it with a term like "Brute Force," "Combinatorial Explosion," or "State-Space
      Search."
    * **Right Panel ("The New Way"):** Shows the same problem, but with your technology creating a direct, elegant path
      through it. The wall becomes a door. The maze has a glowing line showing the solution. The tangled graph is
      simplified.
* **Text:** Minimal labels. No sentences.

#### **Slide 3: The Demonstration**

* **Title:** Proof.
* **Visual:** The most compelling, undeniable evidence of the prototype's power. This is the "gasp" slide. Choose one:
    * **A GIF:** Showing a complex problem being solved in real-time, impossibly fast.
    * **A Code Snippet:** 3-4 lines of your code achieving something that would normally take hundreds of lines, with
      the stunning output shown next to it.
    * **A Data Visualization:** A "before" and "after" chart showing a massive performance gain (e.g., a bar chart
      with "Current SOTA: 10 hours" next to "[Our Tech]: 1 second").
* **Caption:** One line. "Protein folding in milliseconds." or "1000-city logistics, solved instantly."

### Module II: The Substance (The "How")

*(Goal: For the technical and skeptical viewer. Establish credibility and defensibility.)*

#### **Slide 4: The Core Principle**

* **Title:** The Core Principle
* **Visual:** A clean, abstract diagram explaining the fundamental insight. Use a powerful analogy.
    * *Example: If it's about search, you could show a diagram of a library. "Old Way: Check every book." "Our Way: The
      books rearrange themselves based on the question."*
* **Text:** A few key labels on the diagram. No other text. The verbal explanation during the presentation carries the
  weight.

#### **Slide 5: The Foundation**

* **Title:** Grounded in Years of Research
* **Visual:** A simple timeline graphic.
    * Mark key years with milestones.
    * Instead of text, use logos of the prestigious journals, conferences, or universities where the research was
      published or developed (e.g., ACM, Nature, IEEE, MIT, Stanford logos).
* **Text:** Just the year and the logo. This slide "shows" the academic pedigree without needing a "Team" slide.

#### **Slide 6: The Platform**

* **Title:** A Foundational Layer
* **Visual:** A layered "stack" diagram.
    * **Bottom Layer:** "Core Algorithm"
    * **Middle Layer:** "SDK / APIs"
    * **Top Layer:** "Applications" (show several icons: finance, science, AI, etc.)
* **Key Info:** Place the GitHub logo and the chosen open-source license (e.g., "Apache 2.0") prominently but subtly on
  this slide. This frames it as a strategic choice, not an afterthought.

---

### Module III: The Opportunity (The "So What?")

*(Goal: Translate technical breakthrough into massive business potential.)*

#### **Slide 7: The Universe of Applications**

* **Title:** A General-Purpose Technology
* **Visual:** A hub-and-spoke diagram.
    * **Center Hub:** Your Technology's Logo/Name.
    * **Spokes:** Pointing to major domains.
    * **Endpoints:** A single, high-value problem for that domain.
        * *Spoke: "Logistics" -> Endpoint: "Real-time Fleet Optimization"*
        * *Spoke: "Bioinformatics" -> Endpoint: "Drug Discovery & Simulation"*
        * *Spoke: "Finance" -> Endpoint: "High-Frequency Risk Analysis"*
        * *Spoke: "AI/ML" -> Endpoint: "Hyperparameter Tuning"*
* **Text:** Just the labels on the diagram.

#### **Slide 8: The Go-to-Market: From Core to Commercial**

* **Title:** Path to Market
* **Visual:** A simple, 3-phase roadmap diagram.
    * **Phase 1: Grow the Core.** Icon: Community/GitHub. Text: "Nurture open-source adoption. Become the industry
      standard."
    * **Phase 2: Identify Beachheads.** Icon: Microscope/Target. Text: "Partner with innovators in 1-2 key verticals.
      Solve their hardest problems."
    * **Phase 3: Build the Business.** Icon: Skyscraper/$$$. Text: "Develop enterprise-grade solutions: Managed Cloud,
      Support, & Services."
* **Key Idea:** This slide directly addresses the "how do you make money?" question by presenting a deliberate,
  de-risked strategy.

#### **Slide 9: The Flywheel**

* **Title:** The Open-Source Flywheel
* **Visual:** A circular, 4-step process diagram.
    1. **Powerful Open-Source Core** attracts...
    2. **Developer Adoption & Community** which enables...
    3. **Use Case Discovery & Validation** which creates demand for...
    4. **Enterprise Solutions (Revenue)** which funds development of the... (arrow back to 1).
* **Purpose:** This reframes the open-source license from a potential liability to your primary engine for growth and
  market discovery.

### Module IV: The Plan (The "Now What?")

*(Goal: A clear, concise call to action. Show you know what to do with their money.)*

#### **Slide 10: The Roadmap**

* **Title:** Accelerating the Future
* **Visual:** A simple table with 3 columns.
  | Focus Area | Now (Prototype)                 | Next 18 Months (With Funding)                               |
