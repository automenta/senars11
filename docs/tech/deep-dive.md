# 1. Core Architecture & Philosophy: The Foundation of Cognitive Intelligence

- **Pragmatism under Scarcity**: The system operates under the fundamental assumption of finite computational resources,
  implementing sophisticated resource allocation strategies.
- **Economic Attention**: A dynamic priority system that directs cognitive focus to the most salient `Task`s based on
  multiple factors including relevance, uncertainty, and potential value.
- **Unified Knowledge Hypergraph**: All `Term`s and `Task`s reside in an integrated `Memory` component with
  sophisticated indexing and retrieval mechanisms.
- **Modularity & Extensibility**: Components are decoupled and assembled by a `SystemFactory`, supporting customization
  and extension for specialized applications.
- **Cognitive Transparency**: All reasoning processes are traceable and explainable, ensuring trustworthiness and
  auditability.

# 2. The Cognitive Cycle: How SeNARS "Thinks" - The Rhythm of Intelligence

The cognitive cycle represents SeNARS' approach to continuous, real-time reasoning. Unlike batch processing systems,
SeNARS operates in discrete cycles that mirror human thought processes, balancing immediate needs with long-term
objectives.

```mermaid

    A[Perception & Ingestion] --> B(Prioritization<br/>Economic Attention Model)
    B --> C{Meta-Cognition<br/>Contradiction & Quality Analysis}
    C --> D[Symbolic Reasoning<br/>Inference on Salient Tasks]

    E --> F{Planning & Action<br/>Goal Achievement & Execution}
    F --> G[Learning & Integration<br/>Experience Processing]
    G --> A
```

| Phase                      | Description                                                                                                                            | Cognitive Load | Output                                         |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Perception & Ingestion** | Ingests new information from the environment into `Task`s using `TaskFactory`. Handles multiple input types and validation.            | Low to Medium  | New `Task` objects with initial state          |
| **Prioritization**         | Calculates the priority of all `Task`s in `Memory` using sophisticated algorithms considering relevance, urgency, and cognitive value. | Medium         | Prioritized task queues and focus sets         |
| **Meta-Cognition**         | Scans for contradictions, reasoning failures, and knowledge gaps, generating goals to address inconsistencies.                         | High           | Contradiction reports and repair goals         |
| **Symbolic Reasoning**     | Applies formal inference rules to high-priority `Task`s to derive new knowledge with complete transparency.                            | High           | Derived `Task`s with reasoning traces          |
| **Neural Enrichment**      | Triggers LM services for creative input, similarity searches, and natural language processing.                                         | Variable       | Enriched knowledge and semantic insights       |
| **Planning & Action**      | For goal tasks, executes planning algorithms and action execution for goal achievement.                                                | Medium to High | Action plans and execution results             |
| **Learning & Integration** | Processes experience, updates beliefs, and consolidates learning for future use.                                                       | Medium         | Updated knowledge base and improved strategies |

**Realizable Potential:**
This cyclical approach enables SeNARS to operate continuously while adapting to new information and changing goals. The
system can handle real-time inputs while maintaining focus on important objectives and learning from experience.

# 3. Knowledge Representation: Narsese Grammar - The Language of Cognition

SeNARS employs a rich, formal grammar called Narsese as the foundation for rigorous, explainable reasoning. This grammar
enables precise expression of complex relationships and supports sophisticated cognitive operations including temporal
reasoning and causal analysis.

| Type                          | Syntax                      | Example                             | Cognitive Purpose                                                |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Inheritance**               | `(subject --> predicate)`   | `(cat --> mammal)`                  | Represents "is-a" relationships and hierarchical knowledge.      |
| **Implication**               | `(premise ==> conclusion)`  | `(raining ==> wet_streets)`         | Represents predictive or causal links with temporal aspects.     |
| **Conjunction**               | `(&, term1, term2, ...)`    | `(&, cat, furry, pet)`              | Represents logical AND and complex, multi-faceted concepts.      |
| **Disjunction**               | `(\|, term1, term2, ...)`   | `(\|, cat, dog, bird)`              | Represents logical OR and alternative possibilities.             |
| **Negation**                  | `(--, term)`                | `(--, (cat --> bird))`              | Represents logical NOT and contradiction handling.               |
| **Temporal Implication**      | `(premise =/> conclusion)`  | `(see_lightning =/> hear_thunder)`  | Represents temporal sequences and cause-effect relationships.    |
| **Retrospective Implication** | `(premise =\\> conclusion)` | `(hear_thunder =\\> see_lightning)` | Represents backward temporal reasoning and diagnostic inference. |
| **Concurrent Implication**    | `(premise <=> conclusion)`  | `(lightning <=> thunder)`           | Represents synchronous or concurrent relationships.              |
| **Instance**                  | `(instance {-- class)`      | `(fluffy {-- cat)`                  | Represents specific instances of general concepts.               |
| **Property**                  | `(object --} property)`     | `(cat --} furry)`                   | Represents attribute relationships and characteristics.          |
| **Operation**                 | `(&/, action, condition)`   | `(&/, clean, dirty_room)`           | Represents conditional operations and action planning.           |

**Advanced Narsese Expressions:**

- **Nested Expressions**: `(cat --> (&, mammal, pet, (furry --> cute)))` - Complex concept combinations
- **Higher-Order Relations**: `((A --> B) --> (C --> D))` - Relationships between relations
- **Temporal Sequences**: `(&/, (A =/> B), (B =/> C))` - Complex temporal reasoning
- **Uncertainty Expressions**: Intrinsic truth value representation with frequency and confidence

This formal grammar is the bedrock of SeNARS' capability for rigorous, explainable reasoning and complex
problem-solving.

# 4. The Neuro-Symbolic Bridge in Detail: Where Logic Meets Creativity

The integration of neural and symbolic components in SeNARS represents a sophisticated approach to cognitive
architecture. Rather than a simple connection, it's a deep, bidirectional integration where each component enhances the
other's capabilities.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Symbolic Reasoner] -- Identifies Gap --> B{LM Service Orchestrator}
    B --> C[HypothesisGenerator]
    B --> D[PlanRepairer]
    B --> E[ExplanationGenerator]
    B --> F[QAService]
    B --> G[ProactiveEnricher]
    B --> H[Semantic Similarity Engine]

    C -- Creative Ideas --> A
    D -- Novel Solutions --> A
    E -- Fluent Narratives --> I[Output]
    F -- Natural Language --> I
    G -- Semantic Insights --> A
    H -- Similarity Matches --> M[Memory]

    subgraph "Symbolic Core"
        A
        M
    end
    subgraph "Neural Services (Intelligent Orchestration)"
        B
        C
        D
        E
        F
        G
        H
    end

    style A fill:#4F86C6,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style B fill:#8E6C88,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style M fill:#9370DB,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

**Integration Mechanisms:**

- **Semantic Embeddings**: Each `Term` maintains vector representations enabling similarity calculations and analogical
  reasoning
- **Dynamic Service Invocation**: The symbolic core intelligently calls neural services when symbolic reasoning
  encounters limitations
- **Bidirectional Learning**: Neural insights are validated and integrated into the symbolic knowledge base; symbolic
  structure guides neural processing
- **Contextual Neural Processing**: Neural services operate with full awareness of current cognitive context and
  objectives

**Realizable Potential:**
This integration enables capabilities beyond either component alone: creative hypothesis generation guided by logical
constraints, precise reasoning enhanced by semantic understanding, and explainable outputs enriched by natural language
fluency.

# 2. The Cognitive Cycle

The system "thinks" in a discrete loop that orchestrates all cognitive processes.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Perception] --> B(Prioritization<br/>Economic Attention Model)
    B --> C{Meta-Cognition<br/>Contradiction Detection}
    C --> D[Reasoning<br/>Inference on Salient Tasks]
    D --> E(Enrichment & Action<br/>LM Services & Action Executor)
    E --> A
```

| Phase              | Description                                                                      |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Perception**     | Ingests new information from the environment into `Task`s.                       |
| **Prioritization** | Calculates the priority of all `Task`s in `Memory`.                              |
| **Meta-Cognition** | Scans for contradictions and reasoning failures, generating goals to fix them.   |
| **Reasoning**      | Applies formal inference rules to high-priority `Task`s to derive new knowledge. |
| **Enrichment**     | Triggers LM services for creative input or executes `Action`s on achieved goals. |

# 3. Knowledge Representation: Narsese

SeNARS uses a rich, formal grammar called Narsese to represent knowledge with precision.

| Type                     | Syntax                     | Example                            | Purpose                                 |
|--------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Inheritance**          | `(subject --> predicate)`  | `(cat --> mammal)`                 | Represents an "is-a" relationship.      |
| **Implication**          | `(premise ==> conclusion)` | `(raining ==> wet_streets)`        | Represents a predictive or causal link. |
| **Conjunction**          | `(&, term1, term2, ...)`   | `(&, cat, furry)`                  | Represents a logical AND.               |
| **Negation**             | `(--, term)`               | `(--, cat)`                        | Represents logical NOT.                 |
| **Temporal Implication** | `(premise =/> conclusion)` | `(see_lightning =/> hear_thunder)` | Represents a temporal sequence.         |

This formal grammar is the foundation for the system's rigorous, explainable reasoning capabilities.

# 4. The Neuro-Symbolic Bridge

The LM is not a black-box brain; it's a suite of specialized services orchestrated by the symbolic core.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Symbolic Reasoner] -- Identifies Gap --> B{LM Service Bus}
    B --> C[HypothesisGenerator]
    B --> D[PlanRepairer]
    B --> E[ExplanationGenerator]
    B --> F[QAService]

    C -- Creative Ideas --> G[Memory]
    D -- Novel Solutions --> G
    E -- Fluent Narratives --> H[Output]
    F -- Natural Language --> H

    subgraph "Symbolic Core"
        A
        G
    end
    subgraph "LM Services (Pluggable)"
        B
        C
        D
        E
        F
    end

    style A fill:#4F86C6,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style B fill:#8E6C88,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

The **Reasoner** maintains control, calling on the **LM** for specific tasks like generating creative hypotheses when
logic reaches an impasse, or translating formal proofs into human-readable text.

# 5. Advanced Reasoning

### Temporal Reasoning

SeNARS has specialized mechanisms for reasoning about time.

- **Temporal Relationship Inference**: Determines relationships between events (before, after, concurrent).
- **Pattern Detection**: Identifies periodic and sequential patterns in data.
- **Future Prediction**: Forecasts future `Task` occurrences based on learned temporal implications.

### Planning

The system supports multiple planning strategies, selectable via configuration.

- **HTN (Hierarchical Task Network)**: The default planner, which decomposes complex goals into primitive, executable
  actions. It's robust and well-suited for structured problems.
- **A* Search**: An experimental, heuristic-based planner that can find optimal paths in a state space.
