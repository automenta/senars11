**Title:** The Thermodynamics of Reason: Generalizing the Assumption of Insufficient Knowledge to Environmental, Economic, and Biological Scarcity

**Abstract**
The trajectory of Artificial Intelligence as of late 2025 is colliding with hard physical limits. The "Scaling Hypothesis"—which assumes intelligence emerges from massive data and compute—rests on an implicit assumption of resource sufficiency that contradicts the reality of a finite planet. This paper generalizes Pei Wang’s **Assumption of Insufficient Knowledge and Resources (AIKR)** to the **Assumption of Insufficient Environmental and Economic Resources (AIEER)**. We propose that sustainable General Intelligence cannot be defined merely by logical capability, but by the efficiency with which it converts scarce resources—energy, water, silicon, and *biological human attention*—into utility. We specifically examine the "Homo Sapien Resource," arguing that as demographic contraction restricts the supply of human labor, AIEER necessitates a transition where human biological input declines as a production factor, shifting the definition of economic value. We project these constraints from the immediate data-center energy crisis of the 2030s to the thermodynamic limits of Kardashev-scale civilizations.

### 1. Introduction: The Collision of Logic and Physics

Pei Wang’s Non-Axiomatic Reasoning System (NARS) posits that real-world intelligence is defined by the necessity to adapt under constraints. An intelligent system never knows enough, and never has enough time to process what it knows. This **Assumption of Insufficient Knowledge and Resources (AIKR)** is the cornerstone of adaptive reasoning.

However, the dominant AI paradigm of the 2020s (Deep Learning) has operated under the opposite assumption: the "Fallacy of Abundance." By externalizing environmental costs, the industry has pursued accuracy through exponential scaling. As of 2025, this approach faces a physical wall. Data centers consume nearly 2% of global electricity, water tables are stressing under evaporative cooling demands, and the supply of high-quality human data is plateauing.

We argue that AIKR must be generalized to the physical substrate. Intelligence is not just a software process; it is a thermodynamic event. We propose **AIEER (Assumption of Insufficient Environmental and Economic Resources)** as the necessary framework for the next era of AI, integrating energy, matter, and the shifting role of the human species into the definition of intelligence.

### 2. The Ontology of AIEER: Mapping the Scarcity

To operationalize AIEER, we must map the hierarchy of insufficient resources that constrain the system.

#### Tier 1: Thermodynamic Resources (The Hardware Substrate)
*   **Energy Density:** With global AI power demand approaching 450 TWh, the constraint is no longer FLOPs, but *Joules per Inference*.
*   **Entropy Export (Cooling):** Intelligence generates heat. The capacity of the local environment (water and air) to absorb this waste heat is a hard physical cap on cluster density.
*   **Materiality:** The geopolitical scarcity of silicon, cobalt, and rare earth elements dictates that hardware is finite and degrading, necessitating software that optimizes for hardware longevity.

#### Tier 2: The Biological Resource (The Homo Sapien Constraint)
Historically, human cognition has been the primary "resource" for economic growth. AIEER recognizes humans as a critical but increasingly insufficient resource in the AI loop:
*   **The Attention Scarcity:** Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) relies on human time. This is the most expensive and slowest resource in the loop.
*   **Demographic Contraction:** With birth rates falling below replacement levels in major technological economies (East Asia, Western Europe, North America), the supply of "new biological minds" to generate new culture and labor is shrinking.
*   **Quality of Life Costs:** Humans require massive energetic overhead (food, housing, healthcare) to maintain cognitive function. Compared to silicon, biological intelligence is energetically inefficient for rote tasks.

### 3. The "Human Resource" Transition: From Input to Output

A key postulate of AIEER is the changing role of the human operator.

**The Current Insufficiency (2025-2035):**
Currently, humans are a bottleneck. The "insufficiency" is the lack of skilled human labelers and engineers relative to the demand for AI development. Under AIEER, the system must optimize to *reduce* its reliance on this scarce biological resource.

**The Future Divergence (2035+):**
As machine autonomy increases, the importance of humans as a *productive resource* (labor/input) declines.
*   **Decoupling:** AIEER predicts that an efficient system must eventually decouple its error-correction from human-in-the-loop dependencies, as biological latency is too high for rapid recursive self-improvement.
*   **The Value Shift:** While humans decline as a *resource* (means of production), they remain the *constraint on utility* (the ends). If the system optimizes purely for resource efficiency without preserving Human Quality of Life (the ultimate economic metric), it fails the "Alignment" test. Therefore, the preservation of the "Human Substrate" becomes a boundary condition, not a fuel source.

### 4. Guiding Principles for AIEER Architectures

If resources are insufficient, "brute force" is not intelligent. We propose three principles for sustainable architectures:

#### I. Metabolic Efficiency (The Joule Standard)
Intelligence is the maximization of future freedom of action per unit of energy dissipated.
*   **Implementation:** Systems must utilize **Sparse Activation** (using only 1% of the brain for a specific task) and **Neuromorphic Computing**. The loss function during training must include a penalty for energy consumption. A model that is 1% less accurate but 50% more energy-efficient is considered "more intelligent" under AIEER.

#### II. Recursive Data Economy
The system must generate its own training signal to escape the scarcity of human data, but it must avoid "Model Autophagy" (collapse due to synthetic errors).
*   **Implementation:** The system must utilize **Active Forgetting**. Just as NARS deletes low-priority concepts, AIEER systems must prune data that does not contribute to thermodynamic utility, reducing storage costs.

#### III. The Locality of Computation
Moving information costs energy and time.
*   **Implementation:** Compute must migrate to the energy source. We envision decentralized "Inference Edges" powered by stranded renewables, rather than monolithic central brains. The system adapts its "thinking speed" to the real-time availability of local power (e.g., solar intermittency).

### 5. Temporal Horizons: The Evolution of Insufficiency

#### Near Future: The Great Filter of Efficiency
In the 2030s, the "Scaling Era" will likely end due to the Jevons Paradox—where efficiency gains drive consumption until the grid breaks. AIEER predicts that the only viable path is **Vertical Optimization** (doing more with fixed power) rather than Horizontal Scaling.
*   *Human Impact:* We will see a bifurcation. "Labor" becomes automated, placing extreme pressure on economic systems to distribute abundance without labor participation. If not managed, the "insufficiency" of consumer purchasing power becomes the system's new bottleneck.

#### Far Future: The Kardashev Limit
Looking toward a Type II (Stellar) civilization, one might assume resources become "sufficient." AIEER argues that insufficiency is a universal constant.
*   **The Landauer Limit:** Even with a Dyson sphere, there is a minimum energy cost to erase a bit of information ($kT \ln 2$).
*   **Cosmic Latency:** As intelligence expands, the speed of light makes global synchronization impossible.
*   **The Ultimate Resource:** In a post-biological cosmos, the rarest resource is no longer energy, but **Information Density**. An advanced intelligence will likely not consume entire galaxies (which is inefficient); it will densify, turning inward to compute at the atomic scale (Feynman’s "plenty of room at the bottom").

### 6. Conclusion

Generalizing AIKR to AIEER reframes the mandate of Artificial Intelligence. We are moving from an era of "Software Logic" to an era of "Planetary Physics."

The definition of a General Intelligence must be updated: **AGI is a system that can achieve complex goals while navigating the assumption of insufficient energy, material, and biological support.** By treating the environment and the human population not as infinite wells to be drawn from, but as fragile constraints to be maintained, we ensure that the rise of machine intelligence does not signal the exhaustion of the world that hosts it.
