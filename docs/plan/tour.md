# Tour System Enhancement Proposal

## Overview

This proposal outlines comprehensive enhancements to the SeNARS tour system to improve functionality evaluation, execution speed, and API ergonomics for both developers and educational users.

## Current State Analysis

The current `scripts/run-tour.js` system provides:
- Timed screenshot capture mode
- Event-driven screenshot capture (default)
- Log-only mode for quick validation
- Support for multiple demo types (`basic-reasoning`, `decision-making`, etc.)

## Enhancement Objectives

1. **Comprehensive Functionality Evaluation** - Support evaluation of all system capabilities
2. **Performance Optimization** - Reduce delays and maximize asynchronous efficiency
3. **API Ergonomics** - Improve usability for evaluation and educational purposes
4. **Educational Enhancement** - Make the system accessible for learning and demonstrations

## Detailed Enhancement Plan

### 1. Comprehensive System Functionality Evaluation

#### Specialized Demo Categories
Create focused demo files for each system capability:

- **Core Reasoning**: `basic-reasoning.nars`, `syllogistic-reasoning.nars`, `causal-reasoning.nars`
- **Temporal Reasoning**: `temporal-reasoning.nars`, `interval-reasoning.nars`
- **Goal Management**: `goal-reasoning.nars`, `decision-making.nars`
- **Procedural Learning**: `procedural-learning.nars`, `operator-examples.nars`
- **Truth Management**: `truth-value-reasoning.js`, `belief-loss-analysis.nars`
- **Complex Inference**: `multi-step-inference.nars`, `hybrid-reasoning.nars`

#### Automated Test Suite
- **Regression Testing**: Compare outputs against expected baselines
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Measure derivation throughput and memory usage
- **Stress Testing**: Large input validation and stability checks
- **Feature-Specific Tests**: Isolated functionality validation

### 2. Performance and Asynchronous Optimizations

#### Server Readiness Detection
Replace fixed delays with dynamic readiness checks:
```javascript
// Instead of 10s fixed wait, check actual server status
async function waitForServerReady() {
    while (!await checkServerStatus()) {
        await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 100));
    }
}
```

#### Parallel Processing
Execute multiple evaluations concurrently:
```javascript
// Run independent evaluations in parallel
await Promise.all(tours.map(tour => runTour(tour, { parallel: true })));
```

#### Intelligent Timeout Logic
Implement event-based termination:
```javascript
// Stop after specific conditions instead of time-based
if (expectedDerivationsReceived || maxDerivationCountReached) {
    terminateEarly();
}
```

#### Resource Optimization
- Configure lightweight settings for evaluation
- Reduce memory limits during tests
- Disable non-essential components
- Use optimized event loops

### 3. Enhanced API Ergonomics

#### Simplified Command Interface
```bash
# Quick evaluations
node scripts/eval basic-reasoning                 # Default evaluation
node scripts/eval -v syllogism                   # Verbose output
node scripts/eval -p performance                 # Performance benchmark
node scripts/eval -t detailed-trace              # Step-by-step trace
```

#### Interactive Evaluation Mode
```bash
node scripts/eval -i                             # Real-time derivation display
```

#### Output Enhancement
- **HTML Reports**: Generate detailed visual reports
- **Comparison Tables**: Show performance/behavior differences
- **Visualization**: Graph representations of concept networks
- **Timing Analysis**: Detailed execution time breakdowns

#### Configuration Presets
- `fast`: Minimal logging, optimized for speed
- `detail`: Full diagnostic information
- `demo`: Presentation-optimized display
- `benchmark`: Performance-focused metrics

#### Advanced Filtering
```bash
# Filter by reasoning type
node scripts/eval --type syllogistic             # Syllogistic demos only
node scripts/eval --type temporal --fast         # Temporal demos, fast mode
node scripts/eval --compare baseline vs optimized # Compare modes
```

#### Educational Enhancements
```bash
node scripts/eval -e basic-reasoning             # Educational mode with explanations
node scripts/eval -s step-by-step                # Detailed reasoning steps
node scripts/eval -x expert-mode                 # Advanced user features
```

#### Programmatic API
```javascript
import { evaluate, compare, benchmark } from './evaluation-api.js';

const results = await evaluate('basic-reasoning', {
    mode: 'event-driven',
    timeout: 5000,
    expectations: expectedOutputs,
    detailed: true
});

const comparison = await compare('event-driven', 'timed', {
    metrics: ['speed', 'accuracy', 'resource-usage']
});
```
