Represented by the comprehensive `reasoner` module, this functions as the formal, logical cognitive engine. The symbolic
component operates on an explicit knowledge base of facts, rules, and relationships using:

- Formal inference rules including `modus-ponens`, `inheritance`, and advanced temporal reasoning
- Complete logical traceability and verification of all reasoning paths
- Mathematical precision in knowledge derivation and validation
- Structured representation of complex relationships and causal chains
- Comprehensive temporal and causal reasoning capabilities

### Unified Cognitive Framework

These cognitive systems operate within a sophisticated unified framework orchestrated by the central `System` component,
featuring:

- Continuous cognitive cycles integrating perception, reasoning, and action
- Intelligent attention mechanisms through the `PriorityManager`
- Comprehensive memory management with short-term and long-term storage
- Real-time learning and adaptation mechanisms
- Complete transparency and auditability through the `Introspection` module
