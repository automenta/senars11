## 3. Core System Architecture

Netention's architecture is built around several key components working in concert to deliver its intelligent and
dynamic capabilities:

### 3.1. Notes

* **Active Agents:** Notes are not static documents but active entities capable of performing tasks, managing
  information, and interacting with the user and the system.
* **Fundamental Unit:** The core unit of interaction in Netention, representing tasks, projects, ideas, or any unit of
  user interest.
* **Dynamic State:** Each Note maintains a dynamic state, including its plan, execution status, and conversation
  history.
* **Tool Utilization:** Notes can leverage external functionalities through Tools to perform actions.
* **User Interaction:** Notes can interact with the user through notifications, prompts, and actionable elements within
  the UI.
* **Graph Interconnection:** Notes are interconnected and categorized through graph relationships, allowing for complex
  knowledge structures and domain tagging.

### 3.2. Agent

* **Intelligent Engine:** The Agent is the driving force behind Note functionality, responsible for interpreting Note
  instructions and user requests.
* **Plan Management:** Creates, manages, and executes Plans to achieve Note objectives, dynamically adapting plans as
  needed.
* **Tool Selection and Invocation:** Selects and invokes appropriate Tools from the Tool Registry to execute plan steps.
* **Memory Maintenance:** Maintains a persistent Memory of interactions and task progress, providing context across
  sessions.
* **User Interaction Management:** Interacts with the User when necessary through system notifications and requests for
  input, facilitating a feedback loop.
* **Adaptive Behavior:** Adapts its behavior based on user context, feedback, and interaction history, learning and
  improving over time.

### 3.3. Plan (Graph-Based Anticipatory Plan)

* **Graph Data Structure:** Plans are represented as directed graphs, allowing for flexible, non-linear, and
  anticipatory planning.
* **Anticipatory Nature:** Plans focus on goals and outcomes, anticipating different scenarios and dynamically adapting
  step execution based on context and results. Steps can be generated dynamically by the LLM.
* **Nodes (Steps):** Represent individual steps or actions within a plan. Each node includes:
    * A description of the step.
    * A status (pending, running, completed, failed, waiting for user input).
    * A designated Tool to be used for execution (if applicable).
    * Arguments for the Tool (if applicable).
    * The result of Tool execution (if applicable).
    * Notes or annotations related to the step.
    * Optional domain tags for categorization.
* **Edges (Dependencies):** Represent dependencies between steps, defining execution order and prerequisite
  relationships. Edges can also represent other relationships, like domain tagging.
* **Dynamic and Hierarchical:** Plans are adaptive and hierarchical, allowing for dynamic step generation, branching
  based on context, and the breakdown of complex tasks into sub-plans.
* **Implicit Dependencies:** Plan step dependencies are often inferred by the LLM, reducing the need for explicit
  dependency declarations, although explicit dependencies are also supported.

### 3.4. Tools

* **Modular Functionalities:** Tools are external, modular functionalities that Agents utilize to perform actions,
  providing access to a wide range of capabilities.

    * User interaction (Notifications, Input Forms).
    * System functionalities (Database Management, Agent Statistics).
    * Third-party services (APIs, Integrations).
    * Graph data manipulation (Subgraph search, metrics, visualization).
* **Tool Definition:** Each Tool is defined by:
    * A name and description.
    * An input schema (defining required parameters, using Zod for validation).
    * An output schema (defining the structure of the result, using Zod for validation).
    * Execution logic (the code that performs the Tool's function).
* **Asynchronous Execution:** Designed to handle asynchronous tool execution, even though the prototype uses mock
  Promises for some tools. Synchronous tools are wrapped to present an asynchronous interface to the system.
* **Unified Executor:** A single `Executor` class simplifies tool use and manages the execution lifecycle.

### 3.5. Memory (Persistent Conversation History)

* **Persistent Record:** Memory is a persistent record of all interactions related to a Note, ensuring context is
  maintained across sessions.
* **Content:** Memory records include:
    * User inputs and requests.
    * System messages and plan updates.
    * Agent's thoughts and reasoning steps.
    * LLM prompts as Notes, enabling revision and contextualization.
    * LLM calls as graph actions, linking prompts, responses, and tool calls.
    * Tool calls and results.
    * Feedback and user annotations.
* **Persistence:** Memory is persistently stored in the graph database, allowing Agents to maintain context and learn
  over time.

### 3.6. User Interface (Flow Note UI)

* **Note Flow View:** A visual representation of a Note's Plan as a dynamic graph, showing steps as nodes and
  dependencies as edges, with real-time updates and interactive elements.
* **Note Editor View:** A text editor for creating and modifying Note content (initial task, instructions), providing
  access to plan visualization, conversation history, and Agent controls.
* **Actionable Notes:** Note elements (nodes in the flow) can contain interactive elements (buttons, links, forms),
  allowing for direct user action and input.
* **System Tray Integration:** Notifications and quick actions are available through the system tray, offering subtle,
  non-intrusive updates and interaction prompts.

### 3.7. Data Storage (Graph Database)

* **Graph Database (LevelDB/levelgraph):** A graph database (LevelGraph built on LevelDB) is used for persistent
  storage, optimized for handling interconnected data.
* **Persistent Storage:** Provides persistent storage for all system data, ensuring data integrity and enabling
  efficient relationship management.

* **Efficient Querying:** The graph database enables efficient querying and traversal of relationships between different
  entities within Netention, crucial for plan management and context retrieval.

### 3.8. LLM Interface (Provider Abstraction)

* **LLM Abstraction Layer:** An abstraction layer is implemented to support multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Ollama,
  Anthropic) through a provider-agnostic API. Currently a thin layer, with plans for potential LangChain.js integration.
* **Provider Flexibility:** Allows for flexible routing of requests to different LLMs based on task requirements, cost,
  or user preferences. Default to smaller models for less demanding tasks.
* **Functionality:** The LLM Interface provides:
    * Provider-agnostic API for making LLM calls.
    * Message formatting and schema conversion for different LLM APIs.
    * Tool/Function call integration (handling tool definition and response parsing for each LLM).
    * Error handling and retry mechanisms for LLM API calls.
* **Prompt Templates:** Reusable prompt templates with placeholders reduce code duplication and improve prompt
  management, stored externally for easy modification.
* **Prompt-as-Note:** Prompts sent to the LLM are represented as Notes within the system, enabling revision,
  contextualization, and potential backpropagation.
* **LLM Calls as Graph Actions:** Interactions with LLMs are represented as nodes in the graph, linking prompts,
  responses, and tool calls for better tracking and analysis.

**The Seed: The Active Note Concept**

The seed of Netention is the **Active Note**. Everything else in the system is a manifestation or extension of this core
concept. We can define the Active Note recursively, in terms of itself and its relationships.

**Recursive Definition (Conceptual - using a blend of natural language and pseudo-code):**

```
ActiveNote = {
    id: UniqueIdentifier,
    type: "ActiveNote", // Self-referential type
    content: String | DataStructure, // Can contain text, data, or references to other Notes
    relationships: [Relationship], // Connections to other ActiveNotes
    behavior: Agent, // The 'engine' that interprets and acts on the content
    state: { // Dynamic state of the Note
        status: String, // e.g., "pending", "active", "completed", "failed"
        plan: Plan, // The plan for achieving the Note's objective (itself a graph of ActiveNotes)
        memory: [Message], // History of interactions (Messages are also ActiveNotes)
    }
}

Relationship = {
    type: String, // e.g., "dependency", "partOf", "relatedTo", "domainTag"
    target: ActiveNote.id, // ID of the related Note
    direction: "undirected" | "sourceToTarget" | "targetToSource",
}

Agent = {
    type: "Agent",
    interpret: (ActiveNote) -> Plan, // Function to generate a plan from the Note's content
    execute: (Plan) -> [Message], // Function to execute the plan (producing a history of Messages)
    selectTool: (Task) -> Tool, // Function to choose the best Tool for a given task
    adapt: (Plan, [Message], Feedback) -> Plan, // Function to modify the plan based on results and feedback
}

Plan = {
    type: "Plan",
    nodes: [ActiveNote],  // Plan steps are themselves ActiveNotes!
    edges: [Relationship], // Dependencies and relationships between steps
    goals: [String], // High-level objectives
    constraints: [String], // Limitations
}

Tool = {
    type: "Tool",
    name: String,
    description: String,
    inputSchema: Schema, // Definition of expected input (using Zod-like schema)
    outputSchema: Schema, // Definition of output format
    execute: (Input) -> Output, // Function to perform the Tool's action (can be async)
}

Message = {
    type: "Message",
    role: "user" | "system" | "agent" | "tool",
    content: String, // Text of the message
    toolCalls: [ToolCall], // If the message involves tool calls
    timestamp: DateTime,
}

ToolCall = {
    tool: Tool.name,
    arguments: Object, // Arguments passed to the tool
    result: Object | null, // Result of the tool call (initially null)
}

Schema = //...  (Definition of a data schema, like Zod)
UniqueIdentifier = //... (UUID or similar)
String = //...
DataStructure = //...
DateTime = //...
Object = //...
Input = //...
Output = //...
Feedback = //...
```

**Explanation and Key Insights:**

1. **Self-Referentiality:** The `ActiveNote` is defined in terms of itself. A Plan is composed of `ActiveNotes`, and
   `Messages` are also `ActiveNotes`. This creates a powerful, recursive structure where everything in the system is
   ultimately a Note.

2. **Relationships as Glue:**  The `Relationship` object connects `ActiveNotes`. Dependencies in a Plan are
   `Relationships`. Domain tagging is a `Relationship`. The connection between a Note and its conversation history (
   Messages) is a `Relationship`.

3. **Agent as Behavior:** The `Agent` is not a separate entity but a *behavior* associated with an `ActiveNote`. This
   simplifies the model; there aren't "Agents" running around, but rather Notes exhibiting "Agent-like" behavior.

4. **Plan as a Graph of Notes:** The `Plan` is not just a list of steps; it's a *graph* of `ActiveNotes`. Each step *is*
   an `ActiveNote`, allowing for hierarchical plans and complex relationships.

5. **Tools as External Functions:** `Tools` are external functions that the `Agent` can call. They are defined by their
   input and output schemas.

6. **Messages as Records:**  `Messages` are `ActiveNotes` that record interactions, including LLM prompts and responses,
   and tool calls.

7. **Everything is a Note (Almost):** The core idea is to unify the system around the `ActiveNote`. This reduces
   complexity and creates a highly cohesive system.

**How to "Grow" the System from this Seed:**

1. **Concrete Implementations:**  Start with concrete implementations of the basic types (`UniqueIdentifier`, `String`,
   `Schema`, etc.).

2. **Graph Database:** Implement the `ActiveNote` and `Relationship` concepts using a graph database (LevelGraph). This
   will naturally handle the relationships and recursive structure.

3. **Agent Logic:** Implement the `Agent`'s `interpret`, `execute`, `selectTool`, and `adapt` functions. This is where
   the LLM integration happens.

4. **Tool Library:** Create a library of `Tools`, each with its defined input and output schemas and `execute` function.

5. **UI as a View:** The UI becomes a *view* of the graph of `ActiveNotes`. The "Flow Note" UI is a visualization and
   interaction mechanism for this graph.

6. **Bootstrapping:**  Create initial `ActiveNotes` to represent:
    * The System Prompt (an `ActiveNote` with the system instructions).
    * The User (an `ActiveNote` representing the user).
    * Core Tools (each Tool can be represented as an `ActiveNote`).
    * Domains/Tags (each Domain is an `ActiveNote`).

7. **Prompt Templates as Notes** Store the prompt templates themselves *as* Active Notes. This allows the system to
   reason about, and even modify, its own prompting strategies.

8. **Self-Improvement Loop:** By using the above structure the system can start operating and its memory will grow
   containing its interactions, new Notes, new Plans, etc. These become available for analysis and improvement. The
   system can use its own tools and agent behavior to modify its plan structure, or the Tools available.

**Example: Creating a Task (Conceptual)**

1. The user creates a new `ActiveNote` with `content` = "Write a report on Q3 sales."

2. The system associates an `Agent` behavior with this Note.

3. The `Agent`'s `interpret` function is triggered. It uses the LLM and the System Prompt (another `ActiveNote`) to
   generate a `Plan`.

4. The `Plan` is a graph of `ActiveNotes`, potentially including:
    * An `ActiveNote` for "Gather sales data" (with a `Relationship` to a "Data Retrieval Tool").
    * An `ActiveNote` for "Analyze data" (with a `Relationship` to a "Data Analysis Tool").
    * An `ActiveNote` for "Write report" (with a `Relationship` to a "Text Generation Tool").

5. The `Agent`'s `execute` function begins executing the Plan, traversing the graph of `ActiveNotes` and invoking Tools
   as needed.

6. All interactions (prompts, responses, tool outputs) are recorded as `Message` `ActiveNotes`, linked to the relevant
   task `ActiveNote`.

**Elegant Form:**

The elegance of this recursive design lies in its:

* **Simplicity:**  Everything is built from a single core concept: the Active Note.
* **Uniformity:**  The same mechanisms (relationships, agent behavior) apply to all parts of the system.
* **Extensibility:**  New capabilities can be added by creating new `Tools` or by defining new types of `Relationships`.
* **Self-Description:** The system's core concepts are defined *within* the system itself, using the same structures
  used for user data.
* **Potential for Self-Improvement:** Because prompts, plans, and even tools can be represented as Notes, the system has
  the potential to reason about and improve its own operation.

This recursive, unified model provides a powerful and flexible foundation for building Netention. It allows for a highly
cohesive system where the same underlying principles apply to tasks, plans, messages, and even the system's own internal
workings. This creates a system that is not only powerful but also conceptually elegant and potentially self-improving.
