# SeNARS Core Cognitive Architecture and Principles

## 1. Vision

Autonomous entity that self-improves with optional user cooperation for general-purpose cognitive tasks.

## 2. Core Cognitive Architecture

### 2.1 Memory System

- Dynamic knowledge hypergraph storing terms, beliefs, goals, and questions
- Context-aware retrieval mechanisms
- Belief revision and consistency management
- Long-term and short-term memory components

### 2.2 Reasoning Engine

- Formal inference system with uncertainty management
- Multi-domain reasoning capabilities
- Causal and temporal reasoning
- Abductive and inductive reasoning mechanisms

### 2.3 Planning System

- Goal-oriented planning with multi-step reasoning
- Hierarchical task decomposition
- Resource allocation and scheduling
- Plan refinement and adaptation

### 2.4 Meta-Cognitive System

- Self-awareness and reflection capabilities
- Constitution compliance monitoring
- Performance self-evaluation
- Cognitive strategy selection

## 3. Self-Improvement Framework

### 3.1 Self-Management System

- Self-assessment → Self-planning → Self-execution → Self-validation
- Goal ingestion from plan documents
- Continuous improvement loop

### 3.2 Self-Improvement Components

- Performance and capability evaluation
- Autonomous generation of improvement plans
- Implementation of planned modifications
- Quality assurance of self-made changes

## 4. General-Purpose Infrastructure

### 4.1 Domain Abstraction Layer

- Universal interfaces for any application domain
- Cross-domain knowledge transfer mechanisms
- Domain-specific adapter systems
- Schema registry and management

### 4.2 Modular Architecture

- Plugin-based extensions with standardized interfaces
- Component lifecycle management
- Dynamic loading and unloading of capabilities
- Interface validation and compatibility checking

### 4.3 MCP Integration

- Connection to external tools via Model Context Protocol
- Service discovery and registration
- Context management between tools
- Error recovery and fallback mechanisms

## 5. Implementation Strategy

- SeNARS implements its own improvements through cognitive reasoning
- Optional user assistance when beneficial for complex tasks
- Focus on turnkey deployment and usability across domains

## 6. Success Criteria

- Autonomous operation without human intervention
- Continuous self-improvement with measurable capability growth
- General-purpose usability across diverse application domains
- Strategic user cooperation with clear value proposition
- Turnkey deployment capability with minimal configuration required
- Safety and constitution compliance maintained during self-modifications
