# SeNARS User Application Framework

## Overview

This document describes how users can leverage SeNARS as an agentic system for their own projects, plans, and
development efforts. While SeNARS demonstrates its capabilities through self-development (dogfooding), the same
cognitive architecture and infrastructure can be applied to any user project or goal.

## 1. User Project Onboarding

### 1.1 Project Initialization

- **Plan Ingestion**: Users provide project plans, goals, or specifications in natural language or structured formats
- **Goal Extraction**: SeNARS parses and identifies key objectives, milestones, and deliverables
- **Resource Assessment**: Evaluate computational and human resources required for the project

### 1.2 Custom Configuration

- **Domain Adaptation**: Adjust cognitive models to the specific domain of the user's project
- **Constraint Definition**: Establish safety constraints, quality standards, and compliance requirements
- **Collaboration Setup**: Configure human collaboration preferences and interaction patterns
- **Success Metrics**: Define measurable outcomes and progress indicators for the project

### 1.3 Workspace Creation

- **Project Isolation**: Create isolated workspace to prevent interference with other projects

### 4.2 Collaborative Development

- **Multi-User Support**: Handle multiple users contributing to the same project
- **Conflict Resolution**: Automatically resolve conflicts in collaborative work
- **Role Management**: Define and enforce different user roles and permissions
- **Communication Tools**: Integrated communication for team collaboration

### 4.3 Adaptive Interfaces

- **Preference Learning**: Learn and adapt to individual user preferences
- **Context Sensitivity**: Adjust interface based on current project context
- **Accessibility Features**: Support users with diverse accessibility needs
- **Multi-Modal Interaction**: Support for text, voice, and other interaction modalities

## 5. Domain-Specific Applications
