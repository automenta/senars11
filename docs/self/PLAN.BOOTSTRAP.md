# SeNARS Bootstrap and Seed Configuration Process

## Overview

This document details the bootstrapping process that enables SeNARS to read and execute the development plan (PLAN.*.md
files) as goals for self-directed development. The bootstrap process demonstrates SeNARS' core capability to
self-improve and evolve through cognitive reasoning - a prime example of "dogfooding" where SeNARS uses its own
capabilities to develop itself.

This approach serves as both:

- A practical demonstration of SeNARS' agentic capabilities for users
- An effective development methodology that continuously improves the system

The plan documents function as a seed configuration for SeNARS, initiating the system's self-directed development
process. By using itself to develop itself, SeNARS provides users with a powerful example of how the system can be
applied to any project: users can follow the same patterns to seed SeNARS with their own plans and goals.
