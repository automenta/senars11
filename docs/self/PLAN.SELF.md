# SeNARS Self-Management of Development Plans

## Overview

This document details how SeNARS implements self-management of the development plan (PLAN.*.md files) as cognitive
goals. It describes the mechanisms by which SeNARS reads, interprets, and manages plan execution as part of its own
cognitive cycle, demonstrating the system's ability to self-direct its development through cognitive reasoning.

This "dogfooding" approach exemplifies SeNARS' agentic capabilities: users can see exactly how SeNARS manages its own
development, providing a working example of how the system can be used to manage any other project or plan.

## 1. Plan Reading and Interpretation

- **Assistance Requests**: Asks for help when system capabilities are insufficient

### 4.2 Collaborative Goal Management

- **Shared Ownership**: Allows humans to contribute to or modify goals
- **Feedback Integration**: Incorporates human feedback into goal refinement
- **Conflict Resolution**: Resolves disagreements between autonomous and human directions
- **Credit Attribution**: Recognizes human contributions to goal achievement

### 4.3 User Experience Optimization

- **Information Presentation**: Clearly displays goal status and system progress
- **Interaction Simplification**: Makes it easy for humans to assist when needed
- **Transparency**: Shows reasoning behind goal choices and execution strategies
- **Trust Building**: Establishes confidence in system's autonomous capabilities

## 5. Performance Monitoring and Reflection

### 5.1 Progress Analytics

- **Velocity Tracking**: Monitors rate of goal achievement over time
- **Efficiency Metrics**: Measures resource usage per goal completion
- **Quality Assessment**: Evaluates quality of achieved goals
- **Error Analysis**: Identifies and learns from goal achievement failures

### 5.2 Systemic Improvement

```

## 7. Failure Handling and Recovery

### 7.1 Failure Detection

- **Goal Stagnation**: Identify when goals aren't progressing
- **Resource Conflicts**: Detect when goals compete for resources
- **Implementation Errors**: Recognize when implementation fails quality checks
- **Constitution Violations**: Flag when proposed changes violate safety constraints

### 7.2 Recovery Strategies

- **Alternative Approaches**: Switch to backup strategies when primary methods fail
- **Goal Decomposition**: Break complex goals into smaller, more manageable components
