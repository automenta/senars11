# SeNARS Self-Management and Self-Improvement Mechanisms

## Overview

This document details how SeNARS will leverage its own cognitive capabilities to manage and execute the development of
the turnkey autonomous entity. Rather than external development, SeNARS will use its reasoning, planning, and execution
capabilities to implement the roadmap items with optional user cooperation.

This document also incorporates the plan reading and interpretation mechanisms that allow SeNARS to treat development
plans as cognitive goals, demonstrating the system's self-directed development approach.
