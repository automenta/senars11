# SeNARS API Documentation

## `NAR` (NARS Reasoner Engine)

The `NAR` class serves as the central orchestrator and public API for the entire reasoning system.

**API:**

- `constructor(config: SystemConfig)`:
    - Initializes the `Memory`, `Focus`, `RuleEngine`, `TaskManager`, and `Cycle` with the provided configuration.
    - `SystemConfig` specifies rule sets (NAL, LM), memory parameters, and other system-wide settings.
- `input(narseseString: string)`: Parses a Narsese string, creates a `Task`, and adds it to the `TaskManager` and `Memory`.
- `on(eventName: string, callback: Function)`: Registers event listeners for various system outputs and internal events (e.g., `'output'`, `'belief_updated'`, `'question_answered'`, `'cycle_start'`, `'cycle_end'`).
- `start()`: Initiates the continuous reasoning cycle.
- `stop()`: Halts the reasoning cycle.
- `step()`: Executes a single reasoning cycle, useful for debugging and controlled execution.
- `getBeliefs(queryTerm?: Term)`: Returns a collection of current beliefs from memory, optionally filtered by a query term.
- `query(questionTerm: Term)`: Submits a question to the system and returns a promise that resolves with the answer.
- `reset()`: Clears memory and resets the system to its initial state.
