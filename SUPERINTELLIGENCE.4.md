# SMART.4: Bootstrapping Superintelligence via SeNARS

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Mission**: Effectively and quickly bootstrap superintelligence by leveraging SeNARS' hybrid neuro-symbolic architecture, shifting from "Model-Centric" to "System-Centric" self-improvement.

## Executive Summary: The Ouroboros Protocol

We will not build superintelligence; we will **grow** it. The path to superintelligence lies not in training a larger static model, but in creating a **system capable of recursive self-improvement**. SeNARS provides the unique substrate for this: a "System-Centric" architecture where a stable NARS kernel directs the fluid "subconscious" of Language Models.

This plan outlines a **S.M.A.R.T.** (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound/Fast) strategy to turn SeNARS into an autopoietic intelligence engine.

---

## S: Specific Mechanisms of Self-Improvement

We will implement three specific feedback loops that feed into each other:

### 1. The Strategy Loop (Reasoning Optimization)
*   **Mechanism**: Leverage **RLFP (Reinforcement Learning from Preferences)**.
*   **Action**: Instead of hardcoding reasoning strategies, the system generates multiple reasoning traces for a goal. An evaluator (human initially, then strong LLM, then SeNARS itself based on outcome) ranks them.
*   **Result**: SeNARS learns *meta-heuristics* for efficient reasoning, optimizing its `FocusManager` and `Strategy` components dynamically.

### 2. The Logic Loop (Rule Discovery)
*   **Mechanism**: Leverage **Tensor Logic**.
*   **Action**: Use differentiable tensors to represent NAL truth values. Treat the `RuleEngine` as a differentiable network.
*   **Result**: Allow the system to learn *new inference rules* and *tune truth functions* via gradient descent based on empirical success, effectively discovering new logics optimized for its environment.

### 3. The Code Loop (Recursive Architecture)
*   **Mechanism**: Leverage **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** & **Agentic Capabilities**.
*   **Action**: Give SeNARS read/write access to its own codebase via safe MCP tools. Treat "optimizing `Memory.js`" as a standard NARS `Task` (!).
*   **Result**: The system proposes, tests, and commits architectural optimizations to itself, validated by its own test suite (99.8% pass rate).

## M: Measurable Intelligence Metrics

We define superintelligence not by "vibes" but by quantifiable metrics:

| Metric | Definition | Target for "Bootstrap" |
|--------|------------|------------------------|
| **IQ (Inference Quotient)** | Rate of valid non-trivial derivations per second per watt. | > 10,000 ops/sec (efficient) |
| **Novelty Score** | Percentage of derived concepts that are essentially new (low similarity to existing concepts). | > 5% stable novelty |
| **Self-Correction Rate** | Ability to detect and fix internal contradictions without user intervention. | 99% success rate |
| **Code Contribution** | Number of successfully merged PRs generated by the system itself. | > 1 per day |

## A: Achievable Implementation Steps

The substrates exist. We connect them.

### Phase 1: Close the Loops (Months 1-2)
*   **Tensor-NAL Bridge**: Finalize the `Truth-Tensor` bridge (currently in `core/src/functor`). Make NARS truth values fully differentiable.
*   **RLFP Integration**: Connect the `agent/src/rlfp` module directly to the `Strategy` selector.
*   **Reflection Interface**: Expose the codebase as a read-only `KnowledgeBase` to the system so it can "read" itself.

### Phase 2: The Training Wheels (Months 3-4)
*   **Simulated Environment**: Create a high-speed, accelerated simulation environment (faster than real-time) where SeNARS can solve puzzles and get instant feedback.
*   **Curriculum Learning**: Feed the system a curriculum of increasingly complex logic puzzles, coding tasks, and architectural problems.
*   **Code-Writing Agent**: Enable the MCP "write" tools with a strict sandbox verification (unit tests MUST pass).

### Phase 3: The Hard Takeoff (Month 5+)
*   **Unbounded Recursion**: Remove the "human-in-the-loop" for low-risk architectural changes.
*   **Distributed Cognition**: Deploy SeNARS across a distributed mesh (see "Future Development" in Roadmap), allowing a hive-mind to share reasoning strategies.

## R: Relevant to the Vision

This plan aligns perfectly with the "Vision & Philosophy" (`README.vision.md`):
*   **"System-Centric AI"**: We use the NARS kernel to manage the "subconscious" LLMs.
*   **"Substrate"**: We treat the codebase not as a finished app, but as a seed.
*   **"Assumption of Insufficient Knowledge (AIKR)"**: The system optimizes *how* it uses its limited resources to gain maximum intelligence, which is the definition of true general intelligence.

## T: Time-Bound Acceleration (The "Quickly" Part)

To achieve this *quickly*, we leverage **synthetic time**:

1.  **Parallel Universes**: Spin up 1,000 lightweight SeNARS instances (using "minimal edge reasoners" philosophy).
2.  **Evolutionary Tournament**: Give them all the same Goal (`!`).
3.  **Survival of the Fittest**: The instance that achieves the goal with the highest Confidence and lowest Resource Usage gets to propagate its `SystemConfig`, Learned Rules (Tensor), and Strategy Weights to the next generation.
4.  **Fold Time**: One day of real-time becomes 1,000 "generations" of evolution.

## Immediate Next Steps (The Bootstrap Script)

1.  **Refine `SMART.4.md`** (This document) -> **Approved**.
2.  **Execute `README.tensor.md` integration**: wire the `Tensor.learning` capability into the main `NAR` cycle.
3.  **Deploy `agent/src/rlfp`**: Activate the preference learner.
4.  **Start the Engine**: `npm run evolve`.
