# Code Guidelines

- Elegant
- Consolidated
- Consistent
- Organized
- Deeply deduplicated: Don't repeat yourself (DRY)

- Abstract
- Modularized
- Parameterized

- Terse syntax
  - Ternary, switch, nullish coalescing, etc... 
  - Adhere to reasonable JavaScript code guidelines  
  - Don't arbitrarily change method functions to arrow functions
  - Consider modern JavaScript language syntax

- Few comments: rely on self-documenting code

- Purpose: professional, not explanatory/educational

- Unit testing: avoid Mocks; test objects directly.
