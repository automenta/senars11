# SeNARS (Semantic Non-axiomatic Reasoning System)

A hybrid neuro-symbolic reasoning system that combines Non-Axiomatic Logic (NAL) with Language Models (LM) to create an
observable platform for exploring advanced AI concepts.

**System Definition:**

- **Hybrid Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning**: Integration of formal symbolic reasoning (NAL) with neural language model
  capabilities
- **Non-Axiomatic Logic (NAL)**: A logic system that does not rely on fixed axioms but adapts based on experience and
  evidence
- **Observable Platform**: A system that provides real-time visibility into its reasoning processes, enabling analysis
  and understanding of its decision-making

---

## Key Architectural Patterns

The SeNARS architecture is built around several fundamental patterns that enable its intelligence and adaptability:

### 1. Immutable Data Foundation

- **Core Data Structures** (Terms, Tasks, Truth, Stamps) are immutable, ensuring consistency and enabling efficient
  caching
- **Canonical Representation**: Equivalent structures normalize to identical forms for efficient comparison and storage
- **Functional Processing**: Operations create new instances rather than modifying existing ones

### 2. Component-Based Architecture

- **BaseComponent Foundation**: All major system components inherit from a common base with standardized lifecycle (
  initialize, start, stop, dispose)
- **Event-Driven Communication**: Components communicate through a centralized EventBus for loose coupling
- **Built-in Metrics**: All components include standardized performance and operational metrics

### 3. Dual Memory Architecture

- **Short-term Focus Memory**: High-priority, limited-capacity memory for immediate processing
- **Long-term Memory**: Persistent storage for all other knowledge and tasks
- **Automatic Consolidation**: Intelligent movement of information between memory types based on priority and usage

### 4. Hybrid Reasoning Integration

- **NAL-LM Collaboration**: Formal symbolic reasoning combined with neural language model capabilities
- **Circuit Breaker Protection**: Automatic fallback mechanisms when external services fail
- **Bidirectional Enhancement**: Each reasoning modality improves the other's effectiveness

### 5. Layer-Based Extensibility

- **Abstract Layer Interface**: Foundation for different types of associative and semantic connections
- **Specialized Implementations**: TermLayer for term connections, EmbeddingLayer for semantic similarity
- **Flexible Extension**: Easy to add new layer types for different reasoning needs

## System Architecture

### Core Components Overview

The system consists of several interconnected components:

- **NAR (NARS Reasoner Engine)**: The main entry point and orchestrator that manages the reasoning cycle and coordinates
  all system components
- **Memory**: Manages concepts, tasks, and knowledge representation; implements both long-term and short-term (focus)
  memory systems
- **Focus Manager**: Handles attention focus sets (short-term memory) that prioritize tasks for immediate processing
  based on attention mechanisms
- **Term**: Core immutable data structure for representing knowledge elements with structural properties that support
  reasoning
- **Task**: Represents units of work or information processed by the system; encapsulates a Term with associated truth
  values, stamps, and processing priorities
- **Reasoning Engine**: Applies NAL and LM rules to generate inferences, conclusions, and new knowledge from existing
  information
- **Parser**: Handles Narsese syntax parsing and generation; converts between human-readable Narsese notation and
  internal Term representations
- **LM (Language Model Integration)**: Provides language model capabilities that complement formal symbolic reasoning
  with neural pattern recognition

### Core Data Structures

#### `Term` Class

The `Term` class represents knowledge in the system and is designed to be immutable for reliability and performance.

**Key Features:**

- **Immutability:** Once created, a `Term` cannot be changed. This ensures data consistency and enables efficient
  caching.
- **Equality and Hashing:**
    - `equals(otherTerm)`: Compares two terms for equality, considering their structure and content.
    - `hashCode()`: Provides a unique hash code for use in collections like Maps and Sets.
- **Factory Construction (`TermFactory`):**
    - All `Term` instances are created via `TermFactory.create(termExpression)`.
    - The factory parses Narsese expressions (like `<A --> B>`) into structured objects.
    - **Normalization:** Automatically normalizes equivalent terms (e.g., `(&, A, B)` and `(&, B, A)` become the same).
    - **Caching:** Reuses identical terms to save memory and speed up comparisons.
- **Properties:**
    - `id`: Unique identifier for the term.
    - `operator`: The logical operator (e.g., `&` for conjunction, `-->` for inheritance).
    - `arity`: Number of sub-components the term has.
    - `complexity`: A measure of how complex the term structure is.
    - `isAtomic`, `isCompound`, etc.: Boolean properties describing the term type.
- **Sub-term Access:**
    - `getComponent(index)`: Access a specific sub-part of the term.
    - `getComponents()`: Get all direct sub-parts.
    - `getAllSubTerms()`: Get all nested parts recursively.
- **Structural Analysis:**
    - `visit(visitorFunction)`: Traverse the term structure applying functions to each part.
    - `reduce(reducerFunction, initialValue)`: Aggregate information across the term structure.

**Technical Definitions:**

- **Term**: The fundamental unit of knowledge representation in the system
- **Atomic Term**: A simple, indivisible term (like "bird" or "red")
- **Compound Term**: A term built from multiple sub-terms using logical operators
- **Term Normalization**: Converting equivalent terms to the same canonical form

#### `Task` Class

The `Task` class represents a unit of work in the system, containing information to be processed along with metadata.

**Key Features:**

- **Immutability:** `Task` instances cannot be changed after creation.
- **Properties:**
    - `term`: The knowledge content of the task (a Term object).
    - `truth`: The certainty of the information (e.g., `{ frequency: 0.9, confidence: 0.8 }`).
    - `stamp`: Metadata tracking where the task came from and how it was derived.
    - `priority`: How important the task is (higher priority tasks get processed first).
    - `type`: The kind of task (BELIEF, GOAL, QUESTION, etc.).
    - `budget`: Resources allocated for processing this task.
- **Methods:**
    - `derive(newTruth, newStamp)`: Creates an updated version of the task with new truth values or metadata.

**Technical Definitions:**

- **Task**: A unit of work containing knowledge and processing instructions
- **Truth Value**: Measures certainty or confidence in the task's information
- **Stamp**: Records the task's origin and derivation history
- **Priority**: Determines processing order among tasks

#### `Truth` Value Representation

The `Truth` class represents the certainty of information with two values: frequency and confidence.

**Key Features:**

- **Immutability:** `Truth` values cannot be changed after creation.
- **Properties:**
    - `frequency`: A number 0-1 indicating how often something is observed as true.
    - `confidence`: A number 0-1 indicating how reliable the frequency value is.
- **Operations:**
    - `combine(otherTruth)`: Merges two truth values using logical rules.
    - `negate()`: Returns the opposite truth value.
    - `equals(otherTruth)`: Compares two truth values for equality.

#### `Stamp` and Evidence Tracking

The `Stamp` class tracks where information came from and how it was derived.

**Key Features:**

- **Immutability:** `Stamp` information is fixed once created.
- **Properties:**
    - `id`: Unique identifier for this stamp.
    - `occurrenceTime`: When this information was created.
    - `source`: Where it came from (user input, system inference, language model, etc.).
    - `derivations`: List of previous stamps this information was derived from.
    - `evidentialBase`: Original evidence that supports this information.
- **Operations:**
    - `derive(parentStamps, newSource)`: Creates a new stamp based on existing ones and a new source.

### Belief vs. Goal: Key Concepts

The system distinguishes between beliefs (what the system knows) and goals (what the system wants to achieve):

**Belief Tasks (.)** represent what the system knows about the world:

- **Purpose**: Store knowledge about the environment
- **Truth Values**: Frequency (how often something is true) and confidence (how reliable the knowledge is)
- **Example**: `<bird --> animal>{0.9, 0.8}.` (The system believes birds are animals 90% of the time with 80%
  confidence)

**Goal Tasks (!)** represent what the system aims to achieve:

- **Purpose**: Define objectives or desired outcomes
- **Truth Values**: Desire (how much the goal is wanted) and confidence (how likely it is to be achievable)
- **Example**: `<task_completed --> desirable>!{0.8, 0.9}.` (The system wants tasks completed with 80% desire intensity
  and 90% confidence)

This design enables reinforcement learning where:

- **Beliefs** model the world and predict action outcomes
- **Goals** drive learning by defining desired behaviors
- The system learns by pursuing goals and updating beliefs based on results

---

## Core System Components

### `NAR` (NARS Reasoner Engine)

The `NAR` class serves as the central orchestrator and public API for the entire reasoning system.

**API:**

- `constructor(config: SystemConfig)`:
    - Initializes the `Memory`, `Focus`, `RuleEngine`, `TaskManager`, and `Cycle` with the provided configuration.
    - `SystemConfig` specifies rule sets (NAL, LM), memory parameters, and other system-wide settings.
- `input(narseseString: string)`: Parses a Narsese string, creates a `Task`, and adds it to the `TaskManager` and
  `Memory`.
- `on(eventName: string, callback: Function)`: Registers event listeners for various system outputs and internal
  events (e.g., `'output'`, `'belief_updated'`, `'question_answered'`, `'cycle_start'`, `'cycle_end'`).
- `start()`: Initiates the continuous reasoning cycle.
- `stop()`: Halts the reasoning cycle.
- `step()`: Executes a single reasoning cycle, useful for debugging and controlled execution.
- `getBeliefs(queryTerm?: Term)`: Returns a collection of current beliefs from memory, optionally filtered by a query
  term.
- `query(questionTerm: Term)`: Submits a question to the system and returns a promise that resolves with the answer.
- `reset()`: Clears memory and resets the system to its initial state.

**Technical Definitions:**

- **NAR (NARS Reasoner Engine)**: The main system orchestrator that manages all components and provides the public API
- **Reasoning Cycle**: The iterative process by which the system processes tasks and generates new knowledge
- **Narsese**: The formal language used to represent knowledge and tasks in the system

### Memory and Focus Management

The `Memory` component manages both long-term memory and short-term attention focus sets through the `Focus` system:

- **Structure:** Uses a `Map<Term, Concept>` for efficient lookup of concepts by their associated terms.
- **Dual Memory Architecture:** Separates focus sets (short-term memory) from long-term memory:
    - **Focus Sets:** Priority-based attention focus sets for immediate processing
    - **Long-term Memory:** Storage for all other tasks and concepts
- **Index Management:** Specialized indexes for different term types (inheritance, implication, similarity, etc.)
- **Concept:** Each concept holds related tasks, ordered by priority, and stores metadata.
- **Operations:**
    - `addConcept(term: Term)`: Creates and adds a new concept.
    - `getConcept(term: Term)`: Retrieves a concept.
    - `addOrUpdateTask(task: Task)`: Adds a task to the relevant concept's storage.
    - `consolidate(currentTime)`: Moves tasks between focus and long-term memory based on priority.

**Technical Definitions:**

- **Memory**: The system component that stores and manages all knowledge representations (Terms, Tasks, Concepts)
- **Concept**: A collection of tasks related to the same term, organized by priority and metadata
- **Dual Memory Architecture**: A system design that separates short-term (focus) and long-term memory for efficient
  processing
- **Focus Sets**: High-priority, short-term memory stores for tasks requiring immediate attention
- **Consolidation**: The process of moving tasks between memory systems based on priority and time factors

### Layer System

The Layer system manages connections between concepts and enables semantic reasoning:

- **Layer Interface**: Foundation for creating different types of connections between knowledge elements
- **TermLayer**: Manages connections between terms with priority-based storage and automatic cleanup of low-priority
  links
- **EmbeddingLayer**: Uses vector embeddings to find semantic similarities between terms and concepts

**Key Features:**

- **Associative Links**: Create and manage connections between concepts and terms
- **Priority Management**: Automatically manages storage by keeping important links and removing less important ones
- **Semantic Reasoning**: Find similarities between terms based on meaning, not just structure
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new types of layers for different reasoning needs

### Focus Management

Handles short-term memory and attention in the system:

- **Short-term Memory**: Maintains a limited set of high-priority tasks for immediate processing
- **Priority Selection**: Chooses which tasks to process based on their importance and urgency
- **Task Promotion**: Moves important tasks from short-term to long-term memory when appropriate

The system uses smart selection to:

- **Balance priorities**: Consider both task importance and how long it's been waiting
- **Diversify reasoning**: Ensure different types of tasks get processed to prevent tunnel vision

### Task Processing and Reasoning Cycle

The system processes tasks in repeating cycles:

1. **Select Tasks:** Choose high-priority tasks from short-term memory
2. **Apply Rules:** Use logical and language model rules to process the tasks
3. **Generate New Knowledge:** Create new inferences, conclusions, and questions
4. **Update Memory:** Store new and updated information
5. **Output Results:** Share important findings through system events

This cycle repeats continuously, allowing the system to reason and learn over time.

### Rule Engine

The Rule Engine applies logical rules to generate new knowledge:

- **Rule Types:** Handles both logical inference rules and language model integration rules
- **Rule Management:** Organize, enable/disable, and track rules efficiently
- **Performance Tracking:** Monitor which rules are most effective

**Rule Categories:**

- **NAL Rules:** Apply formal logic to derive new conclusions from existing knowledge
- **LM Rules:** Use language models to enhance reasoning with neural pattern recognition

### Parser System

Converts between human-readable Narsese language and internal system representations:

- **Narsese Processing**: Parse input like `<bird --> animal>{0.9, 0.8}.` into internal structures
- **Truth Value Parsing**: Extract frequency and confidence values from `{f,c}` format
- **Punctuation Support**: Handle different task types using punctuation (. for beliefs, ! for goals, ? for questions)
- **Complex Terms**: Parse nested structures with various logical operators like `(&, A, B)` for conjunction

### Language Model Integration (`LM`)

Connects the system to external language models for enhanced reasoning:

- **Provider Management**: Supports multiple providers (OpenAI, Ollama, Anthropic) with automatic failover
- **Smart Selection**: Chooses the best model for each task based on requirements
- **Circuit Breakers**: Prevents system failures if language model services become unavailable
- **Narsese Translation**: Converts between natural language and the system's formal language
- **Fallbacks**: Continues operating with pure logical reasoning if language models fail

### Supporting System Components

#### Text User Interface (`TUI`)

Command-line interface for interacting with the system:

- **REPL**: Interactive command-line interface for direct system interaction
- **Command Processing**: Handles user commands and displays results

#### Server Components

Network services for remote access and monitoring:

efficiently:

1. **Parse Components:** If the term is compound, parse its components.
2. **Recursive Normalization:** Recursively normalize all sub-terms.
3. **Apply Operator Rules:**
    - For commutative operators (`&`, `|`, `+`, `*`): Sort components lexicographically by their string representation.
    - For associative operators (`&`, `|`): Flatten nested structures.
    - For redundancy: Remove duplicate components.
4. **Reconstruct Term:** Build the normalized term from the processed components.
5. **Cache Check:** Check the factory's cache for an existing equivalent term.
6. **Store/Return:** If found in cache, return the cached instance; otherwise, freeze the new term, store it in the
   cache, and return it.

### Memory Management Algorithms

## General-Purpose Reinforcement Learning Foundation

The SeNARS architecture naturally supports general-purpose reinforcement learning through its foundational Belief-Goal
distinction:

- **World Model Learning**: Belief tasks with frequency-confidence truth semantics form predictive models of environment
  dynamics
- **Reward Structure Definition**: Goal tasks with desire-confidence truth semantics define reward functions for policy
  learning
- **Exploration-Exploitation Balance**: Truth value revision mechanisms naturally implement the fundamental RL tradeoff
- **Policy Learning**: Task processing adapts action selection based on predicted outcomes and desired goals
- **Continuous Adaptation**: The system learns through experience by updating beliefs from environmental feedback while
  pursuing goals
- **Transfer Learning**: Knowledge gained in one domain transfers to related domains through structural similarity

This enables SeNARS to function as a general-purpose reinforcement learning system where:

- **Beliefs** form the world model that predicts outcomes of actions
- **Goals** define the reward structure that guides policy learning
- **Interaction** enables the system to learn by attempting to achieve goals and updating beliefs based on outcomes
- **Adaptation** allows continuous learning from experience through truth value revision mechanisms

The separation of these concept types with distinct truth semantics enables SeNARS to naturally implement the
exploration-exploitation balance fundamental to reinforcement learning, where beliefs guide exploitation of known
knowledge while goals drive exploration toward desired outcomes.

## Core Technical Challenges

### Core Technical Challenges

**Term Normalization and Equality:**

- The Term implementation requires refinement to achieve full immutability - some computed properties need proper
  freezing
- The equality method `equals()` needs implementation of canonical normalization for commutative and associative
  operators
- Without proper normalization, logically equivalent terms (e.g., `(&, A, B)` vs `(&, B, A)`) may be treated as
  different objects

**Performance Optimization:**

- Performance targets (<1ms operations) require optimization in the full NARS reasoning cycle
- Extensive validation and metrics collection may impact runtime performance
- Complex reasoning chains with multiple rule applications may require algorithmic improvements

**Memory Management:**

- The dual memory architecture (focus/long-term) consolidation mechanisms can be optimized for better scalability
- Memory pressure handling and forgetting policies need refinement to better preserve important knowledge
- The memory index system may benefit from optimization as the knowledge base grows

### System Architecture Considerations

**Component Decoupling:**

- The NAR component exhibits coupling with sub-components (Memory, TaskManager, RuleEngine, etc.)
- Further decoupling can improve maintainability
- Testing individual components in isolation can be enhanced through better interface design

**Scalability:**
