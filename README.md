# SeNARS (Semantic Non-axiomatic Reasoning System)

A hybrid neuro-symbolic reasoning system that combines Non-Axiomatic Logic (NAL) with Language Models (LM) to create an
observable platform for exploring advanced AI concepts. The system implements a continuous, stream-based dataflow
architecture for processing streams of premises into conclusions.

**System Definition:**

- **Stream Reasoner**: A continuous, stream-based dataflow architecture that transforms streams of premises into streams
  of conclusions. It utilizes a non-blocking pipeline (`PremiseSource` → `Strategy` → `RuleProcessor`) to handle
  synchronous NAL logic and asynchronous Language Model calls simultaneously.
- **Non-Axiomatic Logic (NAL)**: A logic system that does not rely on fixed axioms but adapts based on experience and
  evidence
- **Observable Platform**: A system that provides real-time visibility into its reasoning processes, enabling analysis
  and understanding of its decision-making

---

## Key Architectural Patterns

The SeNARS architecture is built around several fundamental patterns that enable effective reasoning and adaptability
through dynamic sampling strategies and configurable reasoning approaches:

### 1. Immutable Data Foundation

- **Core Data Structures** (Terms, Tasks, Truth, Stamps) are immutable, ensuring consistency and enabling efficient
  caching
- **Canonical Representation**: Equivalent structures normalize to identical forms for efficient comparison and storage
- **Functional Processing**: Operations create new instances rather than modifying existing ones

### 2. Component-Based Architecture

- **BaseComponent Foundation**: All major system components inherit from a common base with standardized lifecycle (
  initialize, start, stop, dispose)
- **Event-Driven Communication**: Components communicate through a centralized EventBus for loose coupling
- **Built-in Metrics**: All components include standardized performance and operational metrics

### 3. Pipeline-Based Architecture

- **Stream-Based Processing**: Continuous pipeline architecture (`PremiseSource` → `Strategy` → `RuleProcessor`) for
  processing streams of premises into conclusions
- **Non-Blocking Execution**: Asynchronous processing to prevent blocking the main event loop
- **Resource Awareness**: Built-in throttling, backpressure handling, and derivation depth limits to manage
  computational resources

### 4. Dual Memory Architecture

- **Short-term Focus Memory**: High-priority, limited-capacity memory for immediate processing
- **Long-term Memory**: Persistent storage for all other knowledge and tasks
- **Automatic Consolidation**: Intelligent movement of information between memory types based on priority and usage

### 5. Hybrid Reasoning Integration

- **NAL-LM Collaboration**: Formal symbolic reasoning combined with neural language model capabilities
- **Circuit Breaker Protection**: Automatic fallback mechanisms when external services fail
- **Bidirectional Enhancement**: Each reasoning modality improves the other's effectiveness

### 6. Layer-Based Extensibility

- **Abstract Layer Interface**: Foundation for different types of associative and semantic connections
- **Specialized Implementations**: TermLayer for term connections, EmbeddingLayer for semantic similarity
- **Flexible Extension**: Easy to add new layer types for different reasoning needs

---

## Async/Sync Hybridization

- **Synchronous Processing**: NAL (Non-Axiomatic Logic) rules execute synchronously for rapid inference
- **Asynchronous Processing**: LM (Language Model) rules execute asynchronously to prevent blocking the main event loop
- **Non-Blocking Pipeline**: Asynchronous LM rules are dispatched without blocking and results are emitted when
  available
- **Unified Output Stream**: Results from both sync and async rules are merged into a unified output stream

---

## Resource Awareness

- **CPU Throttling**: Configurable CPU throttle interval to prevent blocking the event loop, adjustable based on system
  load
- **Backpressure Handling**: Advanced detection when output consumers slow down with adaptive processing rate
  adjustments
- **Derivation Depth Limits**: Configurable maximum derivation depth to keep the derivation graph finite, tasks
  exceeding the limit are discarded to comply with AIKR (Assumption of Insufficient Knowledge and Resources)
- **Consumer Feedback**: Mechanisms to adjust processing based on downstream capacity

---

### Practical Use Cases

**Knowledge Discovery:**

- Input: Domain-specific facts and relationships
- Process: System discovers implicit connections and patterns
- Output: Previously unknown relationships or insights

**Decision Support:**

- Input: Current situation and possible options
- Process: Weighs pros/cons based on system knowledge
- Output: Recommended actions with confidence levels

**Educational Tool:**

- Input: Student questions and knowledge state
- Process: Explains concepts with logical reasoning chains
- Output: Step-by-step explanations of how conclusions are reached

```

The SeNARS Stream Reasoner is a continuous, stream-based dataflow architecture that transforms streams of premises into
streams of conclusions. This architecture enables hybrid neuro-symbolic reasoning with NAL (Non-Axiomatic Logic) and
Language Models (LM) in a resource-aware, continuous processing pipeline.

### Core Components

#### PremiseSource

The `PremiseSource` generates a continuous stream of `Task`s, drawing from `Memory` based on tunable sampling
objectives.

#### Built-in Implementations:

- `TaskBagPremiseSource`: Samples from a priority bag with configurable strategies
- `PremiseSources`: A bag of multiple `PremiseSource`s that samples proportionally

#### Sampling Objectives:

- `priority`: Sample tasks based on their priority value (default: true)
- `recency`: Favor tasks that are closest to a target time (default: false)
- `punctuation`: Focus on Goals (`!`) or Questions (`?`) (default: false)
- `novelty`: Favor tasks with fewer reasoning steps (lower derivation depth) (default: false)
- `dynamic`: Enable performance-based strategy adaptation (default: false)

#### Strategy

The `Strategy` component receives the stream of primary premises and creates premise pairs by finding suitable secondary
premises using various selection algorithms. Different strategy implementations provide different reasoning approaches:

- **BagStrategy**: NARS-style priority-sampled bag approach for anytime reasoning
- **ExhaustiveStrategy**: Comprehensive search for all related beliefs for a given task
- **PrologStrategy**: Goal-driven backward chaining with Prolog-style unification and resolution
- **ResolutionStrategy**: Goal-driven backward chaining for Prolog-like resolution, e.g., question answering

#### RuleExecutor

The `RuleExecutor` indexes all registered rules for fast retrieval and performs symbolic guard analysis to optimize rule
execution through:

- Deduplication & ordering of common checks
- Subsumption detection
- Constant folding

#### RuleProcessor

The `RuleProcessor` consumes premise pairs and executes rules in a non-blocking fashion:

- Synchronous NAL rules are executed immediately and results are emitted
- Asynchronous LM rules are dispatched without blocking and results are emitted when available
- Results are merged into a unified output stream

#### Reasoner

The main `Reasoner` class manages the continuous reasoning pipeline:

- Manages pipeline lifecycle with `start()`, `stop()`, `step()` methods
- Exposes a single `outputStream` for consumers
- Implements resource constraints (CPU throttling, derivation depth limits)

---

## Key Objectives

**Key Design Objectives:**

- **Simplicity:** Reduce complexity and eliminate over-engineering.
- **Robustness:** Create stable, predictable, and error-resistant core components.
- **Consistency:** Establish clear conventions for API design, data structures, and code style.
- **Testability:** Ensure all parts of the system are comprehensively testable with unit and integration tests.
- **Extensibility:** Design for easy addition of new features, reasoning capabilities, and rule sets.
- **Performance:** Optimize critical paths, especially for `Term` and `Memory` operations.

---

## System Architecture

### Core Components Overview

The system consists of several interconnected components:

- **NAR (NARS Reasoner Engine)**: The main entry point and orchestrator that manages the reasoning cycle and coordinates
  all system components
- **PremiseSource**: Generates a continuous stream of `Task`s, drawing from `Memory` based on tunable sampling
  objectives (e.g., `TaskBagPremiseSource`)
- **Strategy**: Creates premise pairs by finding suitable secondary premises for reasoning approaches (BagStrategy,
  PrologStrategy, ExhaustiveStrategy, etc.)
- **RuleExecutor**: Indexes all registered rules for fast retrieval and performs symbolic guard analysis to optimize
  rule execution
- **RuleProcessor**: Consumes premise pairs and executes rules in a non-blocking fashion, handling both synchronous NAL
  and asynchronous LM rules
- **Reasoner**: Manages the continuous reasoning pipeline with `start()`, `stop()`, `step()` methods and implements
  resource constraints
- **Memory**: Manages concepts, tasks, and knowledge representation; implements both long-term and short-term (focus)
  memory systems
- **Focus Manager**: Handles attention focus sets (short-term memory) that prioritize tasks for immediate processing
  based on attention mechanisms
- **Term**: Core immutable data structure for representing knowledge elements with structural properties that support
  reasoning
- **Task**: Represents units of work or information processed by the system; encapsulates a Term with associated truth
  values, stamps, and processing priorities
- **Reasoning Engine**: Applies NAL and LM rules to generate inferences, conclusions, and new knowledge from existing
  information
- **Parser**: Handles Narsese syntax parsing and generation; converts between human-readable Narsese notation and
  internal Term representations
- **LM (Language Model Integration)**: Provides language model capabilities that complement formal symbolic reasoning
  with neural pattern recognition

### Core Data Structures

#### `Term` Class

The `Term` class represents knowledge in the system and is designed to be immutable for reliability and performance.

**Key Features:**

- **Immutability:** Once created, a `Term` cannot be changed. This ensures data consistency and enables efficient
  caching.
- **Equality and Hashing:**
    - `equals(otherTerm)`: Compares two terms for equality, considering their structure and content.
    - `hashCode()`: Provides a unique hash code for use in collections like Maps and Sets.
- **Factory Construction (`TermFactory`):**
    - All `Term` instances are created via `TermFactory.create(termExpression)`.
    - The factory parses Narsese expressions (like `(A --> B)`) into structured objects.
    - **Normalization:** Automatically normalizes equivalent terms (e.g., `(&, A, B)` and `(&, B, A)` become the same).
    - **Caching:** Reuses identical terms to save memory and speed up comparisons.
- **Properties:**
    - `id`: Unique identifier for the term.
    - `operator`: The logical operator (e.g., `&` for conjunction, `-->` for inheritance).
    - `arity`: Number of sub-components the term has.
    - `complexity`: A measure of how complex the term structure is.
    - `isAtomic`, `isCompound`, etc.: Boolean properties describing the term type.
- **Sub-term Access:**
    - `getComponent(index)`: Access a specific sub-part of the term.
    - `getComponents()`: Get all direct sub-parts.
    - `getAllSubTerms()`: Get all nested parts recursively.
- **Structural Analysis:**
    - `visit(visitorFunction)`: Traverse the term structure applying functions to each part.
    - `reduce(reducerFunction, initialValue)`: Aggregate information across the term structure.

**Technical Definitions:**

- **Term**: The fundamental unit of knowledge representation in the system
- **Atomic Term**: A simple, indivisible term (like "bird" or "red")
- **Compound Term**: A term built from multiple sub-terms using logical operators
- **Term Normalization**: Converting equivalent terms to the same canonical form

#### `Task` Class

The `Task` class represents a unit of work in the system, containing information to be processed along with metadata.

**Key Features:**

- **Immutability:** `Task` instances cannot be changed after creation.
- **Properties:**
    - `term`: The knowledge content of the task (a Term object).
    - `truth`: The certainty of the information (e.g., `{ frequency: 0.9, confidence: 0.8 }`).
    - `stamp`: Metadata tracking where the task came from and how it was derived.
    - `priority`: How important the task is (higher priority tasks get processed first).
    - `type`: The kind of task (BELIEF, GOAL, QUESTION, etc.).
    - `budget`: Resources allocated for processing this task.
- **Methods:**
    - `derive(newTruth, newStamp)`: Creates an updated version of the task with new truth values or metadata.

**Technical Definitions:**

- **Task**: A unit of work containing knowledge and processing instructions
- **Truth Value**: Measures certainty or confidence in the task's information
- **Stamp**: Records the task's origin and derivation history
- **Priority**: Determines processing order among tasks

#### `Truth` Value Representation

The `Truth` class represents the certainty of information with two values: frequency and confidence.

**Key Features:**

- **Immutability:** `Truth` values cannot be changed after creation.
- **Properties:**
    - `frequency`: A number 0-1 indicating how often something is observed as true.
    - `confidence`: A number 0-1 indicating how reliable the frequency value is.
- **Operations:**
    - `combine(otherTruth)`: Merges two truth values using logical rules.
    - `negate()`: Returns the opposite truth value.
    - `equals(otherTruth)`: Compares two truth values for equality.

#### `Stamp` and Evidence Tracking

The `Stamp` class tracks where information came from and how it was derived.

**Key Features:**

- **Immutability:** `Stamp` information is fixed once created.
- **Properties:**
    - `id`: Unique identifier for this stamp.
    - `occurrenceTime`: When this information was created.
    - `source`: Where it came from (user input, system inference, language model, etc.).
    - `derivations`: List of previous stamps this information was derived from.
    - `evidentialBase`: Original evidence that supports this information.
- **Operations:**
    - `derive(parentStamps, newSource)`: Creates a new stamp based on existing ones and a new source.

### Belief vs. Goal: Key Concepts

The system distinguishes between beliefs (what the system knows) and goals (what the system wants to achieve):

**Belief Tasks (.)** represent what the system knows about the world:

- **Purpose**: Store knowledge about the environment
- **Truth Values**: Frequency (how often something is true) and confidence (how reliable the knowledge is)
- **Example**: `(bird --> animal){0.9, 0.8}.` (The system believes birds are animals 90% of the time with 80%
  confidence)

**Goal Tasks (!)** represent what the system aims to achieve:

- **Purpose**: Define objectives or desired outcomes
- **Truth Values**: Frequency (desired frequency) and confidence (how likely it is to be achievable)
- **Example**: `(task_completed --> desirable)!{0.8, 0.9}.` (The system wants the task to be 80% completed with 90%
  confidence)

This design enables reinforcement learning where:

- **Beliefs** model the world and predict action outcomes
- **Goals** drive learning by defining desired behaviors
- The system learns by pursuing goals and updating beliefs based on results

### Reinforcement Learning from Preferences (RLFP): Teaching SeNARS How to Think

SeNARS incorporates a Reinforcement Learning from Preferences (RLFP) framework to optimize its internal reasoning
strategies and align them with human preferences for effective, coherent, and efficient thought. Rather than simply
programming *what* the system thinks, RLFP enables teaching the system *how* to think more effectively.

**Core Concepts:**

- **Learning from Preferences**: Instead of explicit reward functions, the system learns from qualitative comparisons
  like "reasoning path A was more insightful than path B"
- **Optimized Decision Making**: RLFP enhances discretionary choices during the reasoning cycle, including task
  selection, rule application, and modality selection between symbolic (NAL) and neural (LM) reasoning
- **Trajectory-Based Learning**: The system captures complete reasoning episodes (trajectories) and learns from user
  feedback on these reasoning paths

**Architecture:**

The RLFP system operates through three functional layers:

1. **Data Layer**: `ReasoningTrajectoryLogger` records complete reasoning episodes, while `PreferenceCollector` gathers
   feedback from users comparing different reasoning paths
2. **Learning Layer**: `RLFPLearner` trains a preference model that predicts the expected preference score for actions
   or trajectories
3. **Policy Layer**: `ReasoningPolicyAdapter` bridges learned insights with core reasoning, using predictions to guide
   decisions in components like `FocusManager` and `RuleEngine`

**Benefits:**

- **Strategic Reasoning**: Ability to prioritize long-term objectives and resist distractions
- **Explainability Awareness**: Preference for generating clear and interpretable reasoning paths
- **Error Recovery**: Recognition of unproductive thought patterns and dynamic pivoting to better strategies
- **Domain Adaptation**: Tailoring thinking style to specific problem domains

The RLFP framework enables SeNARS to develop increasingly effective and trustworthy reasoning patterns through
continuous learning from human preferences.

## Core System Components

### `NAR` (NARS Reasoner Engine)

The `NAR` class serves as the central orchestrator and public API for the entire reasoning system.

**API:**

- `constructor(config: SystemConfig)`:
    - Initializes the `Memory`, `Focus`, `RuleEngine`, `TaskManager`, and `Cycle` with the provided configuration.
    - `SystemConfig` specifies rule sets (NAL, LM), memory parameters, and other system-wide settings.
- `input(narseseString: string)`: Parses a Narsese string, creates a `Task`, and adds it to the `TaskManager` and
  `Memory`.
- `on(eventName: string, callback: Function)`: Registers event listeners for various system outputs and internal
  events (e.g., `'output'`, `'belief_updated'`, `'question_answered'`, `'cycle_start'`, `'cycle_end'`).
- `start()`: Initiates the continuous reasoning cycle.
- `stop()`: Halts the reasoning cycle.
- `step()`: Executes a single reasoning cycle, useful for debugging and controlled execution.
- `getBeliefs(queryTerm?: Term)`: Returns a collection of current beliefs from memory, optionally filtered by a query
  term.
- `query(questionTerm: Term)`: Submits a question to the system and returns a promise that resolves with the answer.
- `reset()`: Clears memory and resets the system to its initial state.

**Stream Reasoner Usage Examples:**

```javascript
const premiseSource = new TaskBagPremiseSource(memory, {priority: true});
const strategy = new BagStrategy();
const ruleExecutor = new RuleExecutor();
const ruleProcessor = new RuleProcessor(ruleExecutor);
const reasoner = new Reasoner(premiseSource, strategy, ruleProcessor, {
    cpuThrottleInterval: 1,
    maxDerivationDepth: 10
});
reasoner.start();
```

**Technical Definitions:**

- **NAR (NARS Reasoner Engine)**: The main system orchestrator that manages all components and provides the public API
- **Reasoning Cycle**: The iterative process by which the system processes tasks and generates new knowledge
- **Narsese**: The formal language used to represent knowledge and tasks in the system

---

## Configuration and Tuning Parameters

### Stream Reasoner Configuration

The Stream Reasoner system exposes several key parameters for fine-tuning system behavior:

**Reasoner Parameters:**

- `cpuThrottleInterval`: Interval in milliseconds between reasoning steps to prevent blocking the event loop (default:
  1ms)
- `maxDerivationDepth`: Maximum derivation depth to keep the derivation graph finite (default: 10)
- `resourceLimits`: Resource management constraints for computational resources

**PremiseSource Sampling Objectives:**

- `priority`: Sample tasks based on their priority value (default: true)
- `recency`: Favor tasks that are closest to a target time (default: false)
- `punctuation`: Focus on Goals (`!`) or Questions (`?`) (default: false)
- `novelty`: Favor tasks with fewer reasoning steps (lower derivation depth) (default: false)
- `dynamic`: Enable performance-based strategy adaptation (default: false)

### Configuration Examples

```javascript
// Basic stream reasoner configuration
const reasoner = new Reasoner(premiseSource, strategy, ruleProcessor, {
    cpuThrottleInterval: 1,
    maxDerivationDepth: 10
});

// Advanced sampling strategy configuration
const advancedPremiseSource = new TaskBagPremiseSource(memory, {
    priority: true,
    recency: true,
    punctuation: true,
    novelty: true,
    dynamic: true,
    weights: {
        priority: 1.0,
        recency: 0.5,
        punctuation: 0.8,
        novelty: 0.3
    }
});
```

---

## Truth & Logic Systems

SeNARS supports multiple reasoning strategies with distinct truth value semantics:

**NAL (Non-Axiomatic Logic) Strategy**:

- Uses probabilistic truth values `{frequency, confidence}` for beliefs
- Implements inheritance, similarity, conjunction, and other NAL operators
- Provides default reasoning with frequency-confidence semantics for uncertainty management

**Prolog Strategy**:

- Implements backward-chaining resolution for goal-driven queries
- Uses unification with variable binding for logical inference
- Bridges formal logical unification with the system's knowledge base for goal-oriented problem solving

### Memory and Focus Management

The `Memory` component manages both long-term memory and short-term attention focus sets through the `Focus` system:

- **Structure:** Uses a `Map<Term, Concept>` for efficient lookup of concepts by their associated terms.
- **Dual Memory Architecture:** Separates focus sets (short-term memory) from long-term memory:
    - **Focus Sets:** Priority-based attention focus sets for immediate processing
    - **Long-term Memory:** Storage for all other tasks and concepts
- **Index Management:** Specialized indexes for different term types (inheritance, implication, similarity, etc.)
- **Concept:** Each concept holds related tasks, ordered by priority, and stores metadata.
- **Operations:**
    - `addConcept(term: Term)`: Creates and adds a new concept.
    - `getConcept(term: Term)`: Retrieves a concept.
    - `addOrUpdateTask(task: Task)`: Adds a task to the relevant concept's storage.
    - `consolidate(currentTime)`: Moves tasks between focus and long-term memory based on priority.

**Technical Definitions:**

- **Memory**: The system component that stores and manages all knowledge representations (Terms, Tasks, Concepts)
- **Concept**: A collection of tasks related to the same term, organized by priority and metadata
- **Dual Memory Architecture**: A system design that separates short-term (focus) and long-term memory for efficient
  processing
- **Focus Sets**: High-priority, short-term memory stores for tasks requiring immediate attention
- **Consolidation**: The process of moving tasks between memory systems based on priority and time factors

### Layer System

The Layer system manages connections between concepts and enables semantic reasoning:

- **Layer Interface**: Foundation for creating different types of connections between knowledge elements
- **TermLayer**: Manages connections between terms with priority-based storage and automatic cleanup of low-priority
  links
- **EmbeddingLayer**: Uses vector embeddings to find semantic similarities between terms and concepts

**Key Features:**

- **Associative Links**: Create and manage connections between concepts and terms
- **Priority Management**: Automatically manages storage by keeping important links and removing less important ones
- **Semantic Reasoning**: Find similarities between terms based on meaning, not just structure
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new types of layers for different reasoning needs

### Focus Management

Handles short-term memory and attention in the system:

- **Short-term Memory**: Maintains a limited set of high-priority tasks for immediate processing
- **Priority Selection**: Chooses which tasks to process based on their importance and urgency
- **Task Promotion**: Moves important tasks from short-term to long-term memory when appropriate

The system uses smart selection to:

- **Balance priorities**: Consider both task importance and how long it's been waiting

4. **Reconstruct Term:** Build the normalized term from the processed components.
5. **Cache Check:** Check the factory's cache for an existing equivalent term.
6. **Store/Return:** If found in cache, return the cached instance; otherwise, freeze the new term, store it in the
   cache, and return it.

## NAR: Cognitive Agent

A NAR is a 'Non-Axiomatic Reasoner' instance.

We are transitioning from **Model-Centric** AI (making the LLM bigger/smarter) to **System-Centric** AI (building a
cognitive architecture *around* the model). The SeNARS Stream Reasoner embodies this transition by treating the Language
Model as a substrate for processing context, while the NAR provides the agency.

**The SeNARS Solution**: The `Focus` and `Bag` systems act as a **Dynamic Context Manager**. The NAR decides *what* goes
into the LM's context window based on goals and urgency.

### The "Operating System" Analogy

Think of the LM as the **CPU/ALU** (Arithmetic Logic Unit). It is incredibly fast at processing symbols and pattern
matching, but it has no state. The NAR acts as the **Kernel**:

- **Scheduler**: The `Reasoner` pipeline determines which process gets CPU (LM) time
- **File System**: The `Memory` and `Term` structures provide persistent storage of state
- **Permissions/Security**: The `Truth` values and `Stamps` determine what information is trusted

### Epistemic Stability (The Anchor)

LMs are fluid. If you ask an LM the same question twice with slightly different settings, you get different answers.
This is fatal for an autonomous agent.

**The NAR's Job**: It provides the **Anchor**. If SeNARS holds a belief `<fire --> hot> {1.0, 0.9}`, it doesn't matter
if the LM hallucinates that fire is cold in a poetic context. The NAR enforces consistency.

### The "Goal" Vector

LMs are reactive. They only complete the pattern you give them. They have no intrinsic drive.

**The NAR's Job**: It holds the **Intention**. By separating Beliefs (`.`) from Goals (`!`), the architecture allows the
system to have a "nagging" drive. The LM might get distracted by a tangent, but the SeNARS `Task` with high priority
remains in the system, forcing the system to return to the objective.

## Current Capabilities vs. Future Roadmap

### Current Features (Available Now)

- **Stream Reasoning Pipeline**: Continuous, non-blocking pipeline architecture (`PremiseSource` → `Strategy` →
  `RuleProcessor`) for processing streams of premises into conclusions
- **Hybrid Logic Processing**: Integration of NAL (Non-Axiomatic Logic) with Language Model capabilities, with
  synchronous NAL and asynchronous LM processing
- **Resource Management**: CPU throttling, backpressure handling, and derivation depth limits to manage computational
  resources
- **Dynamic Sampling**: Configurable sampling objectives (priority, recency, punctuation, novelty) for task selection
- **Extensible Architecture**: Pluggable components supporting different reasoning strategies (Bag, Prolog, Exhaustive)
- **Robust Data Foundation**: Immutable data structures (Terms, Tasks, Truth, Stamps) with canonical representation and
  functional processing
- **Event-Based Communication**: Components communicate through a centralized EventBus for loose coupling with built-in
  metrics

## General-Purpose Reinforcement Learning Foundation

The SeNARS architecture naturally supports general-purpose reinforcement learning through its foundational Belief-Goal
distinction:

- **World Model Learning**: Belief tasks with frequency-confidence truth semantics form predictive models of environment
  dynamics
- **Reward Structure Definition**: Goal tasks define reward functions for policy learning
- **Exploration-Exploitation Balance**: Truth value revision mechanisms naturally implement the fundamental RL tradeoff
- **Policy Learning**: Task processing adapts action selection based on predicted outcomes and desired goals
- **Continuous Adaptation**: The system learns through experience by updating beliefs from environmental feedback while
  pursuing goals
- **Transfer Learning**: Knowledge gained in one domain transfers to related domains through structural similarity

This enables SeNARS to function as a general-purpose reinforcement learning system where:

- **Beliefs** form the world model that predicts outcomes of actions
- **Goals** define the reward structure that guides policy learning
- **Interaction** enables the system to learn by attempting to achieve goals and updating beliefs based on outcomes
- **Adaptation** allows continuous learning from experience through truth value revision mechanisms

The separation of these concept types with distinct truth semantics enables SeNARS to naturally implement the
exploration-exploitation balance fundamental to reinforcement learning, where beliefs guide exploitation of known
knowledge while goals drive exploration toward desired outcomes.
