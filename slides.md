# SeNARS

Semantic Non-Axiomatic Reasoning System

<div class="center text-sm opacity-75">
Advancing AI Power and Reliability through Neuro-Symbolic Cognition
</div>

---

## Introduction

A complete cognitive architecture designed for a synergistic union of:

- **Formal symbolic reasoning** (Non-Axiomatic Logic)
- **Semantic power of Language Models (LMs)**
- **Observable reasoning processes** for transparency

SeNARS combines the best of both worlds to create a transparent, reliable, and adaptive AI system.

---

## The Challenge

Today's powerful AI models often suffer from critical limitations:

- 📦 **Black Box Problem**: "Why did it do that?" is often unanswerable
- 📉 **Instability**: Minor input changes can cause catastrophic failures
- 🧩 **Poor Abstract Reasoning**: Struggles with logic, causality, and long-term planning

These limitations create massive barriers to deploying AI in high-value, regulated industries.

<div class="center text-sm opacity-75 mt-4">
SeNARS addresses these fundamental limitations through principled design

## Core Components: Term, Task, and Memory

SeNARS is built on three fundamental immutable data structures:

<div class="grid grid-cols-3 gap-4 mb-4">
  <div class="text-center p-4 bg-blue-500 bg-opacity-20 rounded">
    <div class="text-2xl">🔤</div>

    <div class="font-bold text-lg">Memory</div>
    <div class="text-sm">Knowledge Graph</div>
  </div>
</div>

---

## Understanding Terms

**Term** - Immutable representations of concepts with structural intelligence:

- **Examples**: `cat`, `(cat --> animal)`, `(cat ==> furry)`
- **Key Properties**:
    - Strict immutability with frozen objects
    - Canonical normalization (e.g., `(&, A, B)` = `(&, B, A)`)
    - Efficient caching in TermFactory
    - Structural analysis with visitor/reducer patterns

---

```javascript
// Example Term structure
const catTerm = new Term({
    components: ['cat'],
    operator: null
});
const inheritanceTerm = new Term({
    components: [catTerm, new Term({components: ['animal']})],
    operator: '-->'
});
```

---

Terms are the building blocks of all knowledge in SeNARS, providing:

- **Normalization**: Automatic reduction of equivalent terms
- **Immutability**: Ensures consistency across reasoning
- **Structural Intelligence**: Visitor/reducer patterns for analysis

---

## Understanding Tasks

**Task** - Stateful cognitive atoms representing beliefs, goals, or questions:

- **Structure**:
    - `term`: Reference to a Term object
    - `punctuation`: `.`, `!`, or `?` (Belief, Goal, Question)
    - `truth`: Truth value object with frequency and confidence
    - `stamp`: Evidence tracking with origin and derivation history
    - `budget`: Attention allocation metrics (priority, durability, quality)
- **Types**:
    - **Belief (.):** What the system knows about the world
    - **Goal (!):** What the system wants to achieve
    - **Question (?):** What the system wants to know

---

```javascript
// Example Task structure
const beliefTask = new Task({
    term: inheritanceTerm,
    punctuation: '.',
    truth: new Truth(1.0, 0.9),
    budget: { priority: 0.8, durability: 0.7, quality: 0.9 }
});
```

----

Tasks represent the dynamic aspects of cognition:

- **Typed Punctuation**: Clear distinction between beliefs, goals, and questions
- **Evidence Tracking**: Complete derivation history with timestamps
- **Attention Management**: Dynamic budget metrics for cognitive focus
- **Truth Semantics**: Enable reinforcement learning (beliefs model world, goals define rewards)

---

## Understanding Memory

**Memory** - Concept-based knowledge graph managing Terms and Tasks:

- **Dual Storage System**:
    - Focus sets: Short-term memory with high-priority tasks
    - Long-term storage: All concepts and tasks with adaptive consolidation
- **Concept Management**:
    - Each concept holds related tasks for the same term
    - Specialized indexes for different term types (inheritance, implication, etc.)
- **Forgetting Mechanisms**: Adaptive consolidation based on priority and activation

## How SeNARS "Thinks"

Think of SeNARS as a **digital brain** with distinct yet synergistic components:

1. **The Logical "Conscious Mind" (RuleEngine)**
    - Handles formal, step-by-step reasoning
    - Analytical and auditable through event-based tracing
    - Ensures every decision can be fully explained

2. **The Creative "Subconscious" (LM)**
    - Provides intuition and semantic understanding
    - Source of novel ideas and fluent language
    - Grounds symbolic knowledge in meaning

3. **The Self-Awareness (Meta-Cognition)**
    - Constantly monitors reasoning performance
    - Improves thinking through feedback loops
    - Ensures consistency and coherence

---

## The Cognitive Cycle

SeNARS operates in discrete cognitive cycles that emulate a stream of consciousness:

1. **Perception** 👁️: Ingest new information from the world
2. **Focus Selection** 🎯: Apply attention to salient tasks in focus sets
3. **Rule Application** 🔍: Apply relevant NAL and LM rules to tasks
4. **Memory Consolidation** 🧠: Update knowledge graph and manage attention
5. **Output Generation** 🌱: Produce answers, beliefs, or actions

---

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Input Processing] --> B[Focus Task Selection]
    B --> C[Rule Application]
    C --> D[Memory Update]
    D --> E[Output Generation]
    E --> F[Task Consolidation]
    F --> A
```

Each cycle is a complete reasoning loop, ensuring continuous learning and adaptation.

---

## Attention Model and Formal Reasoning

SeNARS implements a pragmatic attention mechanism that focuses computational resources like a stream of consciousness.

Budget calculation factors:
| Factor | Description | Impact |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **Priority** | Task importance metric | Higher priority = higher selection probability |
| **Durability** | Persistence requirements | Longer-term tasks maintained in focus |
| **Quality** | Relevance and usefulness | Higher quality tasks receive more attention |

---

SeNARS implements rigorous, explainable reasoning through formal inference rules:

| Rule             | Structure                          | Purpose                        |
|------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Deduction**    | `(M --> P), (S --> M) ⊢ (S --> P)` | Classical logical deduction    |
| **Induction**    | `(M --> P), (M --> S) ⊢ (S --> P)` | Evidence-based generalization  |
| **Abduction**    | `(P --> M), (S --> M) ⊢ (S --> P)` | Hypothesis generation          |
| **Analogy**      | `(M --> P), (M <-> S) ⊢ (S --> P)` | Structure-preserving inference |
| **Modus Ponens** | `(P ==> Q), P ⊢ Q`                 | Conditional reasoning          |

---

## The Neuro-Symbolic Bridge

SeNARS integrates LMs as a specialized service layer rather than a black box:

- **ProviderRegistry**: Registry and selection of multiple LM providers
- **ModelSelector**: Dynamic model selection based on task requirements
- **NarseseTranslator**: Bidirectional translation between Narsese and natural language
- **CircuitBreaker**: Resilient operation with fallback mechanisms

This creates powerful synergy: the **RuleEngine** provides rigor, while the **LM** provides creativity and grounding.

---

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[RuleEngine NAL & LM Rules] <--> B[Memory Concept Storage]
    B <--> C[LM Language Model Engine]

    C --> C1[ProviderRegistry]
    C --> C2[ModelSelector]
    C --> C3[NarseseTranslator]
    C --> C4[CircuitBreaker]

    A -- Triggers when needed --> C
    C -- Enriched Knowledge --> B
    B -- Provides context --> A
```

---

## Meta-Cognition and Reasoning

SeNARS is designed for **adaptive self-improvement**:

1. **Performance Monitoring**: Constantly tracks rule effectiveness and reasoning outcomes
2. **Analysis**: Classifies successful and failed reasoning patterns
3. **Adaptation**: Adjusts rule priorities and reasoning strategies based on metrics

---
