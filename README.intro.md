# SeNARS (Semantic Non-axiomatic Reasoning System)

A hybrid neuro-symbolic reasoning system that combines Non-Axiomatic Logic (NAL) with Language Models (LM) to create an observable platform for exploring advanced AI concepts. The system implements a continuous, stream-based dataflow architecture for processing streams of premises into conclusions.

## System Definition

SeNARS is a **Stream Reasoner**: A continuous, stream-based dataflow architecture that transforms streams of premises into streams of conclusions. It utilizes a non-blocking pipeline to handle synchronous NAL logic and asynchronous Language Model calls simultaneously.

For detailed architecture, see [README.architecture.md](README.architecture.md).

## Summary

SeNARS is a sophisticated hybrid neuro-symbolic reasoning system that combines the precision of formal logic with the flexibility of neural language models. Built on immutable data structures and a component-based architecture, it provides an observable platform for advanced AI reasoning with:

- **Hybrid Intelligence**: Seamless integration of symbolic (NAL) and neural (LM) reasoning
- **Self-Improving Architecture**: Intelligence that grows through use and experience
- **Observable Reasoning**: Clear visibility into how conclusions are reached
- **Practical Applications**: From knowledge discovery to decision support systems
- **Robust Design**: Fault-tolerant with graceful degradation and comprehensive error handling

The system's architecture enables compound intelligence where each addition enhances overall capabilities, making it suitable for research, education, and production applications requiring transparent and adaptable AI reasoning.
